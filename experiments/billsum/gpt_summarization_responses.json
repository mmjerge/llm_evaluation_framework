FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) it is in the national interest that the public lands \n        are producing and continue to produce water and soil \n        conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage and \n        recreation and other multiple use opportunities;\n            (2) rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved \n        long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, \n        public partnerships and flexibility in management programs and \n        agreements;\n            (3) to assure sound management and stewardship of the \n        renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is \n        reasonable and equitable and represents the fair value of the \n        forage provided;\n            (4) the intermingled private-public land ownership patterns \n        prevailing in much of the west create a strong interdependence \n        between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat \n        for both wildlife and livestock;\n            (5) the social and economic infrastructure of many rural \n        communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas of \n        rural America are highly independent on the protection of the \n        value of privately held production units on Federal lands.\n\nSEC. 2.

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Marine of World War II \nCongressional Gold Medal Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory \n        in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the \n        European and Pacific theaters.\n            (2) The United States Merchant Marine was integral in \n        providing the link between domestic production and the fighting \n        forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, \n        commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas.\n            (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the \n        indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a \n        1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy \n        could not have accomplished its mission''.\n            (4) President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied \n        Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \n        throughout the world''.\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \n        the availability of resources and that the United States \n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \n        submarines, and mines.\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \n        war.\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \n        during this war.''.\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \n        winning World War II.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives \nand the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate \narrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold \nmedal of appropriate design to the U.S. Merchant Marine of World War \nII, in recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World \nWar II.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to \nin subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to \nas the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) American Merchant Marine Museum.--\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \n        honor of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the gold medal shall be \n        given to the American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be \n        available for display as appropriate and available for \n        research.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative heavy metal \n        that poses a significant risk to human health, wildlife, and \n        the environment.\n            (2) Mercury discharges into the atmosphere and surface \n        oceans have increased two-to-five fold since the beginning of \n        the industrialized period due to human activities.\n            (3) Substantial evidence is accumulating that exposure to \n        methyl-mercury is widespread in the general public and \n        occurring at higher than health-based levels of concern \n        according to the Food and Drug Administration, the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, and the World Health \n        Organization. Fish and seafood caught or sold in the United \n        States are contaminated with methyl-mercury, a toxic element \n        that may cause neurological damage and other health-related \n        problems as a result of fish or seafood consumption.\n            (4) According to the 1997 Environmental Protection Agency \n        Mercury Report to Congress, mercury levels in the following \n        fish, at least occasionally, exceeded the Food and Drug \n        Administration's ``action level'' limit of 1 part per million: \n        tilefish, king mackerel, shark, swordfish, tuna, lobster, red \n        snapper, saltwater and freshwater bass, bluefish, bluegills, \n        catfish, crappie, groupers, hake, halibut, northern pike, \n        walleye, largemouth bass, pompano, snook, sunfish, and other \n        finfish.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women \n        and women of childbearing age not to eat shark, king mackerel, \n        tilefish, and swordfish and to limit consumption of all other \n        fish to 12 ounces per week. The Food and Drug Administration \n        advises other persons to limit their consumption of shark and \n        swordfish to no more than 7 ounces per week.\n            (6) The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that \n        women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, nursing \n        mothers, and young children limit fish consumption to 6 meals \n        per week of cooked fish or an 8-ounce meal per week for \n        uncooked fish for adults and 2 meals per week of cooked fish or \n        a 3-ounce meal per week of uncooked fish for young children.\n            (7) In 2003, 44 States issued health advisories that warned \n        the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared to \n        27 States that issued such advisories in 1993.\n            (8) Eleven States warn pregnant women and young children to \n        limit consumption of canned tuna, the most consumed fish in the \n        United States, to 1 or 2 cans per week and some States warn \n        that the ``white'' albacore canned tuna has significantly \n        higher mercury levels than the ``light'' tuna, based upon Food \n        and Drug Administration testing.\n            (9) Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination \n        Survey Centers indicates that 7.8 percent of women of \n        childbearing age have blood mercury levels in their bodies \n        above what is considered safe for the developing fetus, \n        translating into over 300,000 babies born each year in the \n        United States at risk of mercury poisoning.\n            (10) Between 30 percent and 50 percent of women of \n        childbearing age are not aware of the methyl-mercury exposure \n        risks from ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish, according to \n        the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (11) A January 2001 report by the United States General \n        Accounting Office (GAO) criticized the Food and Drug \n        Administration for not providing guidance to the fishing \n        industry to identify and prevent fish contaminated with mercury \n        from reaching consumers, even though the Agency's own \ntesting found that, for example, over half of the swordfish exceeded \nits action level of one part per million (ppm).\n            (12) Evidence is continuing to emerge linking increased \n        risk of coronary heart disease to mercury exposure, as \n        presented in at least 2 peer reviewed studies.\n            (13) Health advisory information on mercury-contaminated \n        fish, which is necessary to protect public health, is not \n        widely known by the State or Federal Government. This lack of \n        awareness potentially threatens tens of millions of Americans \n        who may unknowingly ingest harmful amounts of mercury because \n        they are not aware of exposure risks from consumption of \n        freshwater fish and seafood.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure that the public is adequately informed about the \n        potential adverse effects of mercury exposure through the \n        consumption of fish products;\n            (2) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n        work cooperatively with other Federal and State agencies, as \n        well as nonprofit organizations, to create appropriate \n        advisories for the distribution to the public of explanations \n        of the potential adverse effects of mercury exposure from fish \n        consumption;\n            (3) require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to work cooperatively with State fish and \n        game officials to create an informative guide for distribution \n        to the public about the dangers of the consumption of \n        recreationally-caught fish;\n            (4) require the Food and Drug Administration to resume its \n        seafood methyl-mercury monitoring program to better document \n        mercury levels in various fish species sold in commerce;\n            (5) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n        cooperation with private and public organizations, to design \n        and implement a National Public Education Program regarding the \n        presence of methyl-mercury in seafood and fish consumption \n        advisories for methyl-mercury; and\n            (6) require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to annually prepare a report on the impacts \n        of mercury on human health and the environment.\n\nSEC. 3.

However, the United States continues to \n        maintain an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery \n        systems that were devised with the Cold War in mind.\n            (2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United States \n        includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear warheads, of which \n        approximately 2,000 are deployed with three delivery \n        components: long-range strategic bomber aircraft, land-based \n        intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched \n        ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United States \n        comprises 93 B-52 and 20 B-2 aircraft. The United States \n        maintains 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United \n        States also maintains 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of \n        which are deployed at sea. Each of those submarines is armed \n        with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear warheads.\n            (3) This Cold War-based approach to nuclear security comes \n        at significant cost. Over the next 10 years, the United States \n        will spend hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining and \n        upgrading its nuclear force, according to the Congressional \n        Budget Office. A substantial decrease in spending on the \n        nuclear arsenal of the United States is prudent for both the \n        budget and national security.\n            (4) The national security interests of the United States \n        can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed \n        nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as stated by the \n        Department of Defense's June 2013 nuclear policy guidance \n        entitled, ``Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United \n        States''. This guidance found that force levels under the \n        Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of \n        Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered \n        into force on February 5, 2011, between the United States and \n        the Russian Federation (commonly known as the ``New START \n        Treaty'') ``are more than adequate for what the United States \n        needs to fulfill its national security objectives'' and that \n        the force can be reduced by up to \\1/3\\ below levels under the \n        New START Treaty to 1,000 to 1,100 warheads.\n            (5) Even without additional reductions in deployed \n        strategic warheads, the United States can save tens of billions \n        of dollars by deploying those warheads more efficiently on \n        delivery systems and by deferring production of new delivery \n        systems until they are needed.\n            (6) Economic security and national security are linked and \n        both will be well served by smart defense spending. Admiral \n        Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated on \n        June 24, 2010, ``Our national debt is our biggest national \n        security threat'' and on August 2, 2011, stated, ``I haven't \n        changed my view that the continually increasing debt is the \n        biggest threat we have to our national security.''.\n            (7) The Government Accountability Office has found that \n        there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear \n        facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of \n        the Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3. REDUCTION IN NUCLEAR FORCES.\n\n    (a) Prohibition on New Long-Range Penetrating Bomber Aircraft.--\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds \nauthorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for any of \nfiscal years 2014 through 2023 for the Department of Defense may be \nobligated or expended for the research, development, test, and \nevaluation or procurement of a long-range penetrating bomber aircraft.\n    (b) Prohibition on F-35 Nuclear Mission.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, none of the funds authorized to be appropriated or \notherwise made available for fiscal year 2014 or any fiscal year \nthereafter for the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy \nmay be used to make the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft capable of \ncarrying nuclear weapons.\n    (c) Reduction in the B61 Life Extension Program.--Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, none of the funds authorized to be \nappropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2014 or any \nfiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense or the Department \nof Energy may be obligated or expended until the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of Energy jointly certify to Congress that the total \ncost of the B61 life extension program has been reduced to not more \nthan $5,000,000,000.\n    (d) Termination of W78 Life Extension Program.--Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, none of the funds authorized to be appropriated \nor otherwise made available for fiscal year 2014 or any fiscal year \nthereafter for the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy \nmay be obligated or expended for the W78 life extension program.\n    (e) Reduction of Nuclear-Armed Submarines.--Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, beginning in fiscal year 2020, the forces of \nthe Navy shall include not more than eight ballistic-missile submarines \navailable for deployment.\n    (f) Limitation on SSBN-X Submarines.--Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law--\n            (1) none of the funds authorized to be appropriated or \n        otherwise made available for any of fiscal years 2014 through \n        2023 for the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended \n        for the procurement of an SSBN-X submarine;

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Defense Support to \nCatastrophic Incident Response Act of 2008''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States faces real threats of man-made and \n        natural disasters which could result in catastrophic \n        consequences to the Nation, its resources, and its people. \n        Because of the scale of the potential consequences of these \n        threats, they may constitute threats to national security and \n        will require the full range of Federal resources to save lives, \n        minimize human suffering, protect property, and mitigate \n        damage.\n            (2) Because of its manpower, communications, logistics, and \n        other capabilities, the Department of Defense is uniquely \n        suited to provide critical support to other departments and \n        agencies of the Federal Government, State and local \n        governments, and governments of the Commonwealths and \n        possessions of the United States in response to a catastrophic \n        incident in the United States.\n            (3) Planning and preparation for and execution of civil \n        support operations in responding to catastrophic incidents in \n        support of the Department of Homeland Security and State and \n        local governments is a national security issue.\n            (4) A successful response to catastrophic incidents in the \n        United States requires coordinated strategic plans and detailed \n        operational plans with specific tasking and sourcing. The \n        Department of Defense must develop such plans and should \n        maintain the required units and assets at the appropriate level \n        of readiness in order to deliver the capabilities which will be \n        required in a response led by the Department of Homeland \n        Security.\n            (5) The National Guard and Reserves are forward-deployed in \n        communities throughout the United States, are integrated with \n        State and local governments, and have considerable homeland-\n        related capabilities. The Department of Defense and the United \n        States Northern Command must therefore consider the plans and \n        capabilities of the National Guard and Reserves, and State and \n        local governments, in plans for civil support operations.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the consensus among climate scientists is overwhelming \n        that climate change is occurring more rapidly than can be \n        attributed to natural causes, and that significant impacts to \n        the water supply are already occurring;\n            (2) among the first and most critical of those impacts will \n        be change to patterns of precipitation around the world, which \n        will affect water availability for the most basic drinking \n        water and domestic water needs of populations in many areas of \n        the United States;\n            (3) drinking water utilities throughout the United States, \n        as well as those in Europe, Australia, and Asia, are concerned \n        that extended changes in precipitation will lead to extended \n        droughts;\n            (4) supplying water is highly energy-intensive and will \n        become more so as climate change forces more utilities to turn \n        to alternative supplies;\n            (5) energy production consumes a significant percentage of \n        the fresh water resources of the United States;\n            (6) since 2003, the drinking water industry of the United \n        States has sponsored, through a nonprofit water research \n        foundation, various studies to assess the impacts of climate \n        change on drinking water supplies;\n            (7) those studies demonstrate the need for a comprehensive \n        program of research into the full range of impacts on drinking \n        water utilities, including impacts on water supplies, \n        facilities, and customers;\n            (8) that nonprofit water research foundation is also \n        coordinating internationally with other drinking water \n        utilities on shared research projects and has hosted \n        international workshops with counterpart European and Asian \n        water research organizations to develop a unified research \n        agenda for applied research on adaptive strategies to address \n        climate change impacts;\n            (9) research data in existence as of the date of enactment \n        of this Act--\n                    (A) summarize the best available scientific \n                evidence on climate change;\n                    (B) identify the implications of climate change for \n                the water cycle and the availability and quality of \n                water resources; and\n                    (C) provide general guidance on planning and \n                adaptation strategies for water utilities; and\n            (10) given uncertainties about specific climate changes in \n        particular areas, drinking water utilities need to prepare for \n        a wider range of likely possibilities in managing and delivery \n        of water.\n\nSEC. 3.

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Advisory Commission on Tax \nReform and Simplification Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and \nreport back to Congress recommendations on simplifying, reforming, or \nreplacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, \n        imposes significant burdens on individuals, businesses, and the \n        economy, is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue \n        Service to administer, and is in need of fundamental reform and \n        simplification.\n            (2) Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in \n        dealing with the Internal Revenue Service--especially those \n        arising from misunderstandings of the Code--could be eliminated \n        or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification.\n            (3) The Internal Revenue Service faces continual difficulty \n        in administering an overly lengthy, complex, and confusing tax \n        code.\n            (4) Taxpayers and tax experts have repeatedly called for a \n        simplification of the current tax code.\n            (5) The complexity of the current code places a significant \n        burden on individual filers, including extensive record \n        keeping, time requirements to prepare returns, gaining an \n        understanding of the exemptions for which they may qualify, and \n        other burdens. This has forced the majority of taxpayers to \n        turn to tax professionals to prepare their tax returns.\n            (6) Congress is continually modifying and correcting the \n        Code, leading to annual uncertainty and only adding to the \n        patchwork of complexity and confusion.\n            (7) The Federal Government's present fiscal outlook for \n        continuing and sustained budget surpluses provides a unique \n        opportunity for the Congress to consider measures for \n        fundamental reform and simplification of the tax laws.\n            (8) Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have \n        not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing \n        broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposals to make such \n        changes.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM AND \n              SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--To carry out the purposes of this Act, there is \nestablished within the legislative branch a National Advisory \nCommission on Tax Reform and Simplification (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Commission''), comprised of 15 members. The membership of the \nCommission shall be as follows:\n            (1) 3 members appointed by the President, 2 from the \n        executive branch of the Government and 1 from private life.\n            (2) 4 members appointed by the majority leader of the \n        Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 3 from private life.\n            (3) 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the \n        Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 1 from private life.\n            (4) 4 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n        Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of Representatives \n        and 3 from private life.\n            (5) 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the House \n        of Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of \n        Representatives and 1 from private life.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nPresident and congressional leadership should draw from a number of \nimportant areas of expertise in composing the Commission, including tax \nexperts familiar with corporate tax issues, international tax issues, \nsmall business tax issues, and family and individual tax issues.\n    (c) Appointments.--Appointments to the Commission shall be made not \nlater than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. RULES OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Quorum.--Nine members of the Commission shall constitute a \nquorum for conducting the business of the Commission.\n    (b) Initial Meeting.--If, after 60 days from the date of the \nenactment of this Act, 5 or more members of the Commission have been \nappointed, members who have been appointed may meet and select the \nChair (or Co-chairs) who thereafter shall have the authority to begin \nthe operations of the Commission, including the hiring of staff.\n    (c) Rules.--The Commission may adopt such other rules as it \nconsiders appropriate.\n    (d) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its \npowers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original \nappointment was made. Any meeting of the Commission or any subcommittee \nthereof may be held in executive session to the extent that the Chair \n(Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of the members of the Commission \nor subcommittee determine appropriate.\n    (e) Continuation of Membership.--Any individual who appointed a \nmember to the Commission by virtue of holding a position described in \nsection 4 ceases to hold such position before the report of the \nCommission is submitted, that member may continue as a member for not \nlonger than the 30-day period beginning on the date that such \nindividual ceases to hold such position.\n\nSEC. 6. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) In General.--The duties of the Commission shall include--\n            (1) to conduct, for a period of not to exceed 18 months \n        from the date of its first meeting, the review described in \n        subsection (b); and\n            (2) to submit to the Congress a report of the results of \n        such review, including recommendations for fundamental reform \n        and simplification of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \n        described in section 10.\n    (b) Review and Issuing Proposals.--The Commission shall review and, \nwhen applicable, issue proposals on--\n            (1) the present structure and provisions of the Internal \n        Revenue Code of 1986, especially with respect to--\n                    (A) its impact on the economy (including the impact \n                on savings, capital formation, capital investment, and \n                international trade);\n                    (B) its impact on families and the workforce \n                (including issues relating to distribution of tax \n                burden and impact on small businesses);\n                    (C) the predictability of the tax code from year to \n                year;\n                    (D) the compliance cost to taxpayers and \n                businesses; and\n                    (E) the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to \n                administer such provisions;\n            (2) whether tax systems imposed under the laws of other \n        countries could provide more efficient, simple, and fair \n        methods of funding the revenue requirements of the Government;\n            (3) whether the income tax should be replaced with a tax \n        imposed in a different manner or on a different base; and\n            (4) whether the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 can be \n        simplified, absent wholesale restructuring or replacement \n        thereof.\n\nSEC. 7.

FINDINGS; POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fishing is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 36,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate.\n            (2) Hunting is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate.\n            (3) Survey data from a recent comprehensive 3-year study \n        entitled ``Factors Related to Hunting and Fishing Participation \n        in the United States'' suggest that an overwhelming majority of \n        Americans approved of fishing and hunting.\n            (4) Anglers and hunters have been and continue to be among \n        the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and \n        conservation practices in the United States.\n            (5) Persons who hunt or fish and organizations related to \n        those activities provide direct assistance to wildlife managers \n        and enforcement officers of Federal, State, and local \n        governments.\n            (6) Funds raised through license, permit, and stamp \n        purchases, as well as through excise taxes on goods used by \n        anglers and hunters, have generated more than $6,000,000,000 \n        for wildlife research and management.\n            (7) Fishing and hunting are essential components of \n        effective wildlife management, in that they tend to reduce \n        conflicts between people and wildlife and provide incentives \n        for the conservation of wildlife and habitats and ecosystems on \n        which wildlife depends.\n            (8) Each State has established one or more agencies staffed \n        by professionally trained fish and wildlife management \n        personnel, has legal authority to manage the fish and wildlife \n        found within the State, and carries out sound programs of fish \n        and wildlife management.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that in \nperforming duties under Federal law, all Federal agencies that have \nauthority to manage a natural resource or the Federal public land and \nwater on which a natural resource depends shall exercise the authority, \nconsistent with section 3(e), in a manner so as to support, promote, \nand enhance hunting and fishing opportunities to the extent permitted \nunder State law and regulation and in accordance with applicable \nFederal law.\n\nSEC. 3. TAKING OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ON FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Federal public land and water shall be open to \naccess and use for fishing and hunting except--\n            (1) as limited by the State in which the Federal public \n        land or water is located; or\n            (2) as limited by the Federal agency responsible for the \n        Federal public land or water--\n                    (A) for reasons of national security;\n                    (B) for reasons of public safety; or\n                    (C) for reasons specifically authorized in \n                applicable statutes.\n    (b) Limitations on Terms of Federal Closure to Fishing or \nHunting.--\n            (1) Limitation on duration.--Any closure of Federal public \n        land or water to fishing or hunting may continue in effect only \n        during the period in which the specific circumstances for which \n        the closure is established exist.\n            (2) Rule of construction.--Any authority of a Federal \n        agency to close particular land or water to hunting or fishing \n        shall not be construed as authority to protect or manage fish \n        or wildlife.\n    (c) Certain Federal Public Land and Water Administered by the \nNational Park Service.--Nothing in this Act shall compel the opening to \nhunting or fishing of national parks or national monuments administered \nby the National Park Service.\n    (d) No Priority.--This section does not require a Federal agency to \ngive preference to fishing or hunting over other uses of Federal public \nland or water or land or water management priorities established in \nFederal law.\n    (e) Authority of the States.--\n            (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act impairs the primacy of \n        State authority in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife \n        on land or water within the State, including Federal public \n        land or water.\n            (2) Federal authority.--Except as expressly provided by Act \n        of Congress, the authority of a Federal agency regarding the \n        taking of fish and wildlife on Federal public land or water \n        managed by the Federal agency shall be no greater than the \n        rights of a private owner of land or water.\n\nSEC. 4.

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Rental Housing Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is a pressing and increasing need for rental \n        housing for rural families and senior citizens, as evidenced by \n        the fact that--\n                    (A) two-thirds of extremely low-income and very \n                low-income rural households do not have access to \n                affordable rental housing units;\n                    (B) more than 900,000 rural rental households (10.4 \n                percent) live in either severely or moderately \n                inadequate housing; and\n                    (C) substandard housing is a problem for 547,000 \n                rural renters, and approximately 165,000 rural rental \n                units are overcrowded.\n            (2) Many rural United States households live with serious \n        housing problems, including a lack of basic water and \n        wastewater services, structural insufficiencies, and \n        overcrowding, as shown by the fact that--\n                    (A) 28 percent, or 10,400,000, rural households in \n                the United States live with some kind of serious \n                housing problem;\n                    (B) approximately 1,000,000 rural renters have \n                multiple housing problems; and\n                    (C) an estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in \n                substandard housing with severe structural damage or \n                without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n            (3) In rural America--\n                    (A) one-third of all renters pay more than 30 \n                percent of their income for housing;\n                    (B) 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 \n                percent of their income for housing; and\n                    (C) 92 percent of all rural renters with \n                significant housing problems pay more than 50 percent \n                of their income for housing costs, and 60 percent pay \n                more than 70 percent of their income for housing.\n            (4) Rural economies are often less diverse, and therefore, \n        jobs and economic opportunity are limited because--\n                    (A) factors that exist in rural environments, such \n                as remoteness and low population density, lead to \n                limited access to many forces driving the economy, such \n                as technology, lending, and investment; and\n                    (B) local expertise is often limited in rural areas \n                where the economies are focused on farming or natural \n                resource-based industries.\n            (5) Rural areas have less access to credit than \n        metropolitan areas since--\n                    (A) banks and other investors that look for larger \n                projects with lower risk seek metropolitan areas for \n                loans and investment;\n                    (B) credit that is available is often insufficient, \n                leading to the need for interim or bridge financing; \n                and\n                    (C) credit in rural areas is often more expensive \n                and available at less favorable terms than in \n                metropolitan areas.\n            (6) The Federal Government investment in rural rental \n        housing has dropped during the last 10 years, as evidenced by \n        the fact that--\n                    (A) Federal spending for rural rental housing has \n                been cut by 73 percent since 1994; and\n                    (B) rural rental housing unit production financed \n                by the Federal Government has been reduced by 88 \n                percent since 1990.\n            (7) To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the \n        Federal Government must work in partnership with State and \n        local governments, private financial institutions, private \n        philanthropic institutions, and the private sector, including \n        nonprofit organizations.\n\nSEC. 3.

        "gpt-4": "The Rural Rental Housing Act of 2003 is a proposed bill to address the lack of affordable rental housing in rural areas. The Act cites a pressing need for such housing, especially for low-income families and senior citizens, and notes that rural economies often have limited job opportunities and less access to credit. The Act proposes that the federal government work with state and local governments, private financial institutions, and other organizations to address this issue. The Act would allow the Secretary of Agriculture to provide assistance to eligible sponsors (public agencies, Indian tribes, for-profit corporations, or private nonprofit corporations) to finance housing projects in rural areas. The assistance could come in the form of loans, grants, interest subsidies, annuities, and other forms of financing.

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``RCAF/RAF-Americans Congressional \nGold Medal Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Europe was at war before the end of 1939. England and \n        her British Commonwealth of Nations, which included the \n        Dominion of Canada, were warring with Nazi Germany.\n            (2) Early in World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force \n        (RCAF) needed large numbers of pilots and the British \n        Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) made Canada a center for \n        aircrew training.\n            (3) Approximately 8,864 Americans volunteered to join the \n        RCAF beginning as early as 1940 and continuing throughout World \n        War II. These RCAF-Americans came from every state in the \n        Union.\n            (4) Many of the RCAF-Americans were urgently needed as \n        flying instructors and helped to fully staff the BCATP \n        operations.\n            (5) Approximately 750 Americans (244 with the highly \n        regarded Eagle Squadrons) also served in Great Britain with the \n        RAF. The Eagle Squadrons served from February, 1941, until \n        September, 1942, and provided the British welcome relief from \n        the stress of losing large numbers of combat pilots.\n            (6) President Franklin Roosevelt called the BCATP the \n        ``Aerodrome Of Democracy''. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie \n        King, General Dwight Eisenhower, and British Prime Minister \n        Winston Churchill, all expressed their gratitude to the United \n        States men and women who took part in the British Commonwealth \n        Air Training Plan.\n            (7) Approximately 3,794 Americans transferred to the U.S. \n        Army Air Force (USAAF) after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The 3 \n        Eagle Squadrons (No.71/No.121/No.133), transferred into the 4th \n        Fighter Group, USAAF in September 1942.\n            (8) The transfer of these courageous RCAF/RAF-Americans \n        helped prevent a shortage of experienced airmen in the \n        aftermath of America's entry into the war.\n            (9) Many of these highly trained and experienced RCAF/RAF-\n        Americans pilots performed crucial roles as flight instructors \n        for the USAAF.\n            (10) The accumulated knowledge and skills possessed by \n        these RCAF/RAF-American airmen resulted in many becoming highly \n        accomplished USAAF combat pilots.\n            (11) One of the most highly decorated military groups, the \n        American Fighter Aces, can count many of these RCAF/RAF-\n        Americans among their venerable ranks.\n            (12) These brave Americans left their families to join the \n        RCAF/RAF and over 800 lost their lives while serving. They \n        represent the exceptional courage that has been displayed in \n        the defense of Freedom throughout our Nation's history.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the \nCongress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in commemoration \nof all U.S. nationals who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force or the \nRoyal Air Force during World War II, both before and after Japan's \nattack on Pearl Harbor, in recognition of their contributions to the \nNation.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal \n        under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the \n        Smithsonian Institution, where it will be available for display \n        as appropriate and available for research.\n            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n        that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n        awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere, \n        particularly at appropriate locations associated with the U.S. \n        nationals described under subsection (a), and that preference \n        should be given to locations affiliated with the Smithsonian \n        Institution.\n\nSEC. 4.

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Appalachian Regional Commission \nReform Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Headquarters.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional \n        Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border \n        Regional Commission, are each headquartered in their respective \n        region;\n            (2) headquartering regional commissions within the region \n        affected is a sensible approach to ensure that the commissions \n        are housed in more affordable locations than the District of \n        Columbia, thereby reducing administrative overhead and making \n        the commissions closer and more accountable to the people the \n        commissions were designed to serve;\n            (3) the Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in \n        this Act as the ``Commission'') is not headquartered in \n        Appalachia but in Washington, DC; and\n            (4) the headquarters of the Commission should be relocated \n        from the District of Columbia to a more affordable location in \n        the Appalachian region so that it is closer and more \n        accountable to the people the Commission was designed to serve.\n    (b) Performance.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Commission was created to help foster economic \n        opportunity and close health and educational disparities in a \n        geographic region of the United States beleaguered by \n        persistent poverty and high unemployment;\n            (2) the Commission remains the sole Federal agency focused \n        singularly on economic revitalization in the Appalachian \n        region;\n            (3) in 1998, Congress charged the Commission with \n        ``address[ing] the needs of severely and persistently \n        distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus[ing] \n        special attention on the areas of greatest need'';\n            (4) the Commission has long been criticized for its \n        shortcomings in fulfilling this mission, including in--\n                    (A) a 1999 study titled ``Mountain Money: Federal \n                Tax Dollars Miss the Mark in Core Appalachia'' by Mark \n                Ferenchik and Jill Ripenhoff for the Columbus Dispatch; \n                and\n                    (B) a 2008 book titled ``Uneven Ground: Appalachia \n                Since 1945'' by Ronald D. Eller;\n            (5) in 2004, the Office of Management and Budget noted the \n        importance of the Commission ``[f]ocusing efforts on . . . \n        targeting assistance to areas of distress'';\n            (6) in 2017, Citizens Against Government Waste \n        characterized the programming of the Commission as duplicative \n        and called for drastic reductions in the budget of the \n        Commission;\n            (7) in 2017, the Office of Management and Budget, citing a \n        Government Accountability Office study, concluded that the \n        Commission should be abolished, and that conclusion was \n        reflected in the fiscal year 2018 budget request submitted by \n        the President;\n            (8) these recent actions reflect a growing chorus that the \n        Commission should be reformed; and\n            (9) therefore, given the long-recognized shortcomings of \n        the Commission, the long-standing criticism of the Commission, \n        and the need to ensure its optimal performance, the time has \n        arrived for the Commission to be reformed.\n    (c) Persistent Poverty.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) using 1960 data, the Commission (which was created in \n        1965) concluded that there were 214 distressed counties in the \n        Appalachian region;\n            (2) in 2017, according to the Commission, there are 84 \n        distressed counties in the Appalachian region, reflecting the \n        areas of most persistent poverty in the region; and\n            (3) therefore, the Commission should be reformed to focus \n        its attention on the areas of most persistent poverty in the \n        region.\n    (d) Area Development Funding for Distressed Counties.--Congress \nfinds that--\n            (1) according to the study by the Columbus Dispatch \n        referred to in subsection (b)(4)(A), of the 22,169 grants \n        issued by the Commission from fiscal year 1966 through fiscal \n        year 1998, none of the 5 counties that received the most \n        Commission funding was considered distressed, and more than \\1/\n        4\\ of all Commission spending during that period went to States \n        with few, if any, distressed counties;\n            (2) according to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, ``[the \n        Commission] policies have concentrated resources in a select \n        few `growth centers' in the [Appalachian] region, expanding \n        services to the poor and growing the mountain middle class, but \n        doing little to alter conditions in the most rural distressed \n        counties or to address systemic political or economic \n        inequalities throughout Appalachia'';\n            (3) until 1995, the Commission allocated up to 20 percent \n        of its area development grants for use in distressed counties;\n            (4) following instructions given to the Commission by the \n        Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n        Representatives in 1995, this allocation was increased by the \n        Commission to 30 percent;\n            (5) section 7.5(c) of the Code of the Commission (as in \n        effect on the date of enactment of this Act) reflects this 1995 \n        policy change and states that the Commission ``will allocate up \n        to 30 percent of Commission area development funds for use in \n        distressed counties'', even though, according to the \n        Commission's public representations, economic conditions in \n        distressed areas of the Appalachian region have not greatly \n        improved since the 1960s;\n            (6) given the persistent levels of poverty in the \n        distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more area \n        development funding and emphasis should be devoted to those \n        counties; and\n            (7) therefore, the allocation described in paragraph (3) \n        should be increased to 60 percent.\n    (e) Grant Expenditures.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code, \n        provides that ``not less than 50 percent of the amount of grant \n        expenditures the Commission approves shall support activities \n        or projects that benefit severely and persistently distressed \n        counties and areas'';\n            (2) given the persistent levels of poverty in the \n        distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more grant \n        expenditures and emphasis should be devoted to those counties; \n        and\n            (3) therefore, the 50 percent threshold in section 14524(d) \n        of title 40, United States Code, should be increased to 60 \n        percent.\n\nSEC. 3. MISSION OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.\n\n    Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by \nstriking subsection (a) and inserting the following:\n    ``(a) Establishment and Mission.--\n            ``(1) Establishment.--There is an Appalachian Regional \n        Commission (referred to in this chapter as the `Commission').\n            ``(2) Mission.--The mission of the Commission shall be to \n        focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development \n        in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent \n        poverty.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

        "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125": "The Keep Americans Working Act aims to keep Americans employed by strengthening and expanding short-time compensation programs that provide employers with an alternative to layoffs. The bill defines short-time compensation programs, provides assistance and guidance to states in implementing these programs, establishes reporting requirements, provides temporary financing for certified programs, sets limitations on payments and employer eligibility, requires participating employers to retain employees, and provides funding for program implementation.",

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug Fairness for \nSeniors Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n        discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n        pay substantially more for prescription drugs than the drug \n        manufacturers' most favored customers, such as health insurers, \n        health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government.\n            (2) On average, older Americans who buy their own \n        prescription drugs pay twice as much for prescription drugs as \n        the drug manufacturers' most favored customers. In some cases, \n        older Americans pay over 15 times more for prescription drugs \n        than the most favored customers.\n            (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n        sustains their annual profits of $20,000,000,000, but causes \n        financial hardship and impairs the health and well-being of \n        millions of older Americans. More than one in eight older \n        Americans are forced to choose between buying their food and \n        buying their medicines.\n            (4) Most federally funded health care programs, including \n        Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, the Public Health \n        Service, and the Indian Health Service, obtain prescription \n        drugs for their beneficiaries at low prices. Medicare \n        beneficiaries are denied this benefit and cannot obtain their \n        prescription drugs at the favorable prices available to other \n        federally funded health care programs.\n            (5) It has been estimated that implementation of the policy \n        set forth in this Act will reduce prescription prices for \n        Medicare beneficiaries by more than 40 percent.\n            (6) In addition to substantially lowering health care costs \n        for older Americans, implementation of the policy set forth in \n        this Act will significantly improve the health and well-being \n        of older Americans and lower the costs to the Federal taxpayer \n        of the Medicare program.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to \nmake prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices, by allowing pharmacies to purchase drugs \nfor Medicare beneficiaries at the substantially reduced price available \nunder the Federal Supply Schedule.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE BENEFICIARY DRUG BENEFIT CARD.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to each \nMedicare beneficiary a drug benefit card that enables the beneficiary \nto purchase covered prescription drugs from participating pharmacies at \nreduced prices pursuant to section 4.\n\nSEC. 4. PARTICIPATING PHARMACIES.\n\n    (a) Agreements to Participate.--Any qualified pharmacy may enter \ninto an agreement with the Secretary that enables the pharmacy to sell \ncovered outpatient drugs to holders of Medicare drug benefit cards at a \nreduced price, by authorizing the pharmacy to operate as a \nparticipating pharmacy under this Act.\n    (b) Right of Participating Pharmacies To Obtain Drugs.--An \nagreement under this section shall entitle the participating pharmacy \nto purchase any covered outpatient drug that is listed on the Federal \nSupply Schedule of the General Services Administration at the \nparticipating pharmacy discount price for that drug determined under \nsubsection (d).\n    (c) Quantity of Drugs Purchased.--An agreement under this section \nshall permit the participating pharmacy to purchase under this Act as \nmuch of a covered outpatient drug as is sold by the pharmacy to holders \nof Medicare drug benefit cards.\n    (d) Participating Pharmacy Discount Price.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall determine a \n        participating pharmacy discount price for each covered \n        outpatient drug.\n            (2) Determination.--The participating pharmacy discount \n        price for a covered outpatient drug shall be determined by \n        adding--\n                    (A) the price at which the drug is available to \n                Federal agencies from the Federal Supply Schedule under \n                section 8126 of title 38, United States Code; plus\n                    (B) an amount that reflects the administrative \n                costs incurred by the Secretary in administering this \n                Act.\n\nSEC. 5.

        "gpt-4": "The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1998 aims to protect Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory prescription drug pricing by manufacturers. The Act finds that older Americans often pay significantly more for prescription drugs than health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government. The Act proposes the creation of a Medicare Beneficiary Drug Benefit Card, which would allow Medicare beneficiaries to purchase prescription drugs at reduced prices. Participating pharmacies would be able to sell these drugs at a reduced price, which would be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

    "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis \nResearch, Cure, and Care Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune, \n        chronic, inflammatory, painful, and disabling diseases that \n        require lifelong timely and appropriate medical intervention \n        and care and have no cure.\n            (2) Current studies indicate that the prevalence of \n        psoriasis in the United States ranges between two and three \n        percent, affecting approximately 7.5 million men, women, and \n        children of all ages, approximately 17,000 individuals in each \n        congressional district, and has an adverse impact on the \n        quality of life for virtually all affected.\n            (3) Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it \n        is not typically a direct cause of death. Psoriasis is commonly \n        and incorrectly considered by insurers, employers, \n        policymakers, and the public as a mere annoyance--a superficial \n        problem, mistakenly thought to be contagious, due to poor \n        hygiene, or both. As such, treatment for psoriasis is often \n        incorrectly categorized as ``cosmetic'' and not ``medically \n        necessary''.\n            (4) Psoriasis is connected with an elevated risk for other \n        serious, chronic, and life-threatening comorbid conditions, \n        including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. \n        A higher prevalence of stroke, atherosclerosis, chronic \n        obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, \n        lymphoma, metabolic syndrome, and liver disease are also found \n        in people with psoriasis as compared to the general population. \n        Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop \n        potentially disabling psoriatic arthritis.\n            (5) The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded a \n        study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and \n        mental disability as other major chronic diseases, including \n        cancer, arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and \n        depression.\n            (6) Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of \n        depression, anxiety, and suicidality (suicidal thoughts, \n        suicide attempts, and completed suicides). Individuals with \n        psoriasis are twice as likely to have thoughts of suicide as \n        people without psoriasis or with other chronic conditions.\n            (7) The risk of premature death is 50 percent higher for \n        people with severe psoriasis. This translates to people with \n        severe psoriasis dying four years earlier, on average, than \n        people without psoriasis.\n            (8) The economic consequences of psoriasis, both for \n        individuals and the health care system, are significant. Total \n        direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis are \n        calculated at $11,250,000,000 with work loss accounting for 40 \n        percent of the cost burden. People with psoriasis have \n        significantly higher health care resource utilization and costs \n        than the general population. Additionally, psoriasis patients \n        with comorbidities are more likely to experience urgent care, \n        have greater rates of hospitalization, more frequent outpatient \n        visits, and incur greater costs than psoriasis patients without \n        comorbidities.\n            (9) Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis \n        may help prevent irreversible joint damage.\n            (10) Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a \n        challenge for patients and their health care providers. A wide \n        range of treatment options is available; however, adverse side \n        effects and success varies from patient to patient. The same \n        treatments do not work for every patient and a treatment that \n        may have been effective for a period of time can stop working.\n            (11) Despite a number of recent breakthroughs that have led \n        to some new treatments, too many people with psoriasis and \n        psoriatic arthritis still cannot live normal lives.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence \n        for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of \n        over $70,000,000,000;\n            (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous \n        effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the \n        western States;\n            (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water \n        projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which \n        there are increasing and competing demands;\n            (4) the justification for providing water at less than full \n        cost was to benefit and promote the development of small family \n        farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this purpose has \n        been frustrated over the years due to inadequate implementation \n        of subsidy and acreage limits;\n            (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use \n        of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and \n        reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers \n        would provide an economic incentive for greater water \n        conservation;\n            (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied \n        eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and \n        subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the \n        historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage \n        limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller \n        farms; and\n            (7) including a means test based on gross income in the \n        reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of carrying \n        out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation laws.\n\nSEC. 3.
