    "question": "A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?",
    "model_response": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) Let's denote the height of the tower as h and the initial distance of the car from the tower as d.\n\n2) When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, tan 45\u00b0 = h/d = 1\n   So, d = h at this point.\n\n3) When the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, tan 60\u00b0 = h/(d-x) = \u221a3\n   Where x is the distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes.\n\n4) From (3), we can write: h = \u221a3(d-x)\n\n5) Substituting the value of h from (2):\n   d = \u221a3(d-x)\n   d/\u221a3 = d-x\n   x = d - d/\u221a3 = d(1 - 1/\u221a3) = d(\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3\n\n6) This distance x was covered in 10 minutes. \n   So, the speed of the car = x/10 = d(\u221a3 - 1)/(10\u221a3) per minute\n\n7) The remaining distance to the tower is d-x = d/\u221a3\n\n8) Time to cover this remaining distance:\n   (d/\u221a3) / [d(\u221a3 - 1)/(10\u221a3)] = 10 / (\u221a3 - 1) \u2248 17.32 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 17.32 more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.",

    "model_response": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) Let's say the original price of the item is x.\n\n2) After the 22% discount, the price becomes: x - 0.22x = 0.78x\n\n3) Then, the $20 coupon is applied, so the final price is: 0.78x - 20\n\n4) We're told that this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price. We can express this as an equation:\n\n   0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90\n\n5) Now, let's solve this equation:\n   0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90\n   0.78x - 0.5x = 1.90 + 20\n   0.28x = 21.90\n   x = 21.90 / 0.28\n   x = 78.21428...\n\n6) Rounding to the nearest cent, the original price was $78.21.\n\nTo verify:\n- 22% discount: 78.21 * 0.78 = 61.0038\n- Apply $20 coupon: 61.0038 - 20 = 41.0038\n- Half of original price: 78.21 / 2 = 39.105\n- Difference: 41.0038 - 39.105 = 1.8988 (which rounds to $1.90)\n\nTherefore, the original price of the item was $78.21.",

We know the total number of sharpeners:\n   x + y = 18\n\n3. We know that white sharpeners cost 1 rupee more than brown ones. Let's say brown sharpeners cost p rupees each. Then white sharpeners cost (p + 1) rupees each.\n\n4. The total cost is 100 rupees, so we can write:\n   px + (p + 1)y = 100\n\n5. Substituting y = 18 - x from step 2 into the equation from step 4:\n   px + (p + 1)(18 - x) = 100\n\n6. Expanding the brackets:\n   px + 18p + 18 - px - x = 100\n\n7.

So we're solving this equation:\n   70 + (x% of 70) = 100\n\n5) In mathematical terms:\n   70 + (x/100 * 70) = 100\n\n6) Simplifying:\n   70 + 0.7x = 100\n\n7) Subtracting 70 from both sides:\n   0.7x = 30\n\n8) Dividing both sides by 0.7:\n   x = 30 / 0.7 = 42.857...\n\n9) Rounding to two decimal places, x \u2248 42.86\n\nTherefore, to bring the price back to 100% of its original value, it needs to be increased by approximately 42.86%.\n\nThis makes sense because a 30% decrease followed by a 42.86% increase brings you back to the original price:\n100 * 0.7 * 1.4286 \u2248 100",

    "model_response": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) Let's denote Q's age as x.\n\n2) We're told that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means:\n   R - Q = Q - T\n\n3) Let's say this difference is y. So:\n   R = x + y\n   T = x - y\n\n4) We're also told that the sum of R and T's ages is 50:\n   R + T = 50\n\n5) Let's substitute what we know about R and T:\n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 50\n\n6) Simplify:\n   2x = 50\n\n7) Solve for x:\n   x = 25\n\n8) So Q is 25 years old.\n\n9) We know that R - Q = y and Q - T = y\n   Therefore, R - T = 2y\n\n10) And we know R + T = 50\n\n11) From algebra, if R + T = 50 and R - T = 2y, then:\n    R = (50 + 2y) / 2\n    T = (50 - 2y) / 2\n\n12) The question asks for the difference between R and Q's age, which is y.\n\n13) We can find this by subtracting Q's age from R's age:\n    y = R - Q = ((50 + 2y) / 2) - 25 = (50 + 2y - 50) / 2 = y\n\nTherefore, the difference between R and Q's age is definitely y, but we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of y.

Let's solve this step-by-step.\n\n1) First, let's say the original price of an item is 100 units (it could be dollars, euros, or any currency).\n\n2) With a 20% discount, the discounted price would be:\n   100 - (20% of 100) = 100 - 20 = 80 units\n\n3) Now, we need to find out by what percentage 80 should be increased to get back to 100.\n\n4) We can use this formula:\n   Percentage increase = (Increase in value / Original value) \u00d7 100\n\n5) In this case:\n   Increase in value = 100 - 80 = 20\n   Original value (after discount) = 80\n\n6) Plugging these into our formula:\n   Percentage increase = (20 / 80) \u00d7 100 = 0.25 \u00d7 100 = 25%\n\nTherefore, the shopkeeper must increase the prices by 25% to return to the original price.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive at first, because we started with a 20% decrease and ended with a 25% increase.

    "model_response": "Let's approach this step-by-step using the capture-recapture method:\n\n1) Let's define our variables:\n   N = Total deer population (what we're trying to find)\n   M = Number of deer tagged in 2001 = 300\n   C = Number of deer caught in 2002 = 500\n   R = Number of tagged deer recaptured in 2002 = 20\n\n2) The capture-recapture method is based on the assumption that the proportion of tagged deer in the second sample is representative of the proportion of tagged deer in the entire population.\n\n3) We can express this as an equation:\n   R/C = M/N\n\n4) Rearranging this equation to solve for N:\n   N = (M * C) / R\n\n5) Now let's plug in our numbers:\n   N = (300 * 500) / 20\n\n6) Let's calculate:\n   N = 150,000 / 20 = 7,500\n\nTherefore, the estimated total deer population in the forest is 7,500.\n\nThis method assumes that:\n- The population is closed (no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration)\n- All animals have an equal chance of being captured\n- Tags are not lost\n- The time between sampling periods is not too long\n\nGiven these assumptions and the data provided, the best estimate for the deer population in the forest is 7,500.",

It means the man will take whichever train arrives first after he reaches the station.\n\n2) The main line train starts at 5:00 AM and runs every 10 minutes.\n   So, the main line train times are: 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, ...\n\n3) The harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and also runs every 10 minutes.\n   So, the harbor line train times are: 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, ...\n\n4) In a 10-minute cycle, the main line train will come first for 8 minutes (from minute 0 to minute 7), and the harbor line train will come first for 2 minutes (from minute 8 to minute 9).\n\n5) The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n6) In this case:\n   - Favorable outcomes (catching the main line train): 8 minutes\n   - Total possible outcomes: 10 minutes\n\n7) Therefore, the probability of catching the main line train (which is the first train for 8 out of 10 minutes) is:\n\n   Probability = 8/10 = 4/5 = 0.8 or 80%\n\nThus, the probability of the man catching the first train (which in this case is the main line train) is 0.8 or 80%.",

We need to arrange 3 children on 3 chairs in a line, with the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim.\n\n2) Now, let's consider the possible arrangements:\n\n   - Susan could be in the first chair and Tim in the second\n   - Susan could be in the first chair and Tim in the third\n   - Susan could be in the second chair and Tim in the third\n\n3) For each of these possibilities, we need to place Zen:\n\n   a) If Susan is in the first chair and Tim in the second:\n      - Zen must be in the third chair\n      This gives us one arrangement: Susan - Tim - Zen\n\n   b) If Susan is in the first chair and Tim in the third:\n      - Zen can be in the second chair\n      This gives us another arrangement: Susan - Zen - Tim\n\n   c) If Susan is in the second chair and Tim in the third:\n      - Zen must be in the first chair\n      This gives us a third arrangement: Zen - Susan - Tim\n\n4) Counting up all the possible arrangements, we get 3 in total.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 ways the teacher can arrange the children satisfying the given condition.",

    "question": "The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more\nholidays. The bill for that month would be :",
    "model_response": "Let's approach this problem step by step:\n\n1) Let's define our variables:\n   f = fixed part of the bill\n   r = rate per call (variable part)\n   x = number of calls\n   y = total bill\n\n2) We can write an equation for the bill:\n   y = f + rx\n\n3) Now we have two equations from the given information:\n   1800 = f + 540r  (Equation 1)\n   2040 = f + 620r  (Equation 2)\n\n4) Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   240 = 80r\n\n5) Solving for r:\n   r = 240 / 80 = 3\n   So, the rate per call is Rs. 3\n\n6) We can substitute this back into Equation 1:\n   1800 = f + 540(3)\n   1800 = f + 1620\n   f = 1800 - 1620 = 180\n   So, the fixed part of the bill is Rs. 180\n\n7) Now we have our complete equation:\n   y = 180 + 3x\n\n8) For the month with 500 calls, we can calculate:\n   y = 180 + 3(500)\n   y = 180 + 1500\n   y = 1680\n\nTherefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls would be Rs. 1680.",

    "model_response": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) First, let's find out how long it takes for each ball to make one full rotation:\n\n   Ball A: 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation\n   Ball B: 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation\n\n2) Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times. This will tell us when both balls will be at the starting point again.\n\n3) To find the LCM, let's first find the prime factors of 13 and 7:\n   \n   13 = 13 (it's already a prime number)\n   7 = 7 (also a prime number)\n\n4) The LCM will be the product of these numbers:\n\n   LCM = 13 \u00d7 7 = 91\n\n5) This means that after 91 minutes, both balls will be at the starting point again.\n\n6) We can verify this:\n   - In 91 minutes, Ball A will have made 91 \u00f7 13 = 7 rotations\n   - In 91 minutes, Ball B will have made 91 \u00f7 7 = 13 rotations\n\nTherefore, the balls will meet at the starting point again after 91 minutes.",
