        "model_response": "## Step 1: Let's denote the original price of each article as P. We know that after the price decrease, Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300.\n\n## Step 2: The price decrease is 15%, which means the new price of each article is 85% of the original price P. We can express this as 0.85P.\n\n## Step 3: We are given that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. This means that the total cost of 5 articles at the new price is $300.\n\n## Step 4: We can express the total cost of 5 articles at the new price as 5 * 0.85P = 300.\n\n## Step 5: To find the new price of each article, we need to solve for P in the equation 5 * 0.85P = 300.\n\n## Step 6: First, we divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get 0.85P = 60.\n\n## Step 7: Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.85 to solve for P, which gives us P = 60 / 0.85.\n\n## Step 8: Calculating 60 / 0.85 gives us P = 70.59 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n## Step 9: However, we are looking for the new selling price of each article after the 15% decrease, which is 0.85P.\n\n## Step 10: We can calculate the new selling price by multiplying P by 0.85, which gives us 0.85 * 70.59.\n\n## Step 11: Calculating 0.85 * 70.59 gives us the new selling price of each article.\n\n## Step 12: The new selling price of each article is approximately $60.05.\n\n## Step 13: However, we need to round this value to one decimal place to match the options given.\n\n## Step 14: Rounding $60.05 to one decimal place gives us $60.1.\n\n## Step 15: However, we made an error in our calculation. We should have calculated the new price per article directly from the given information that 5 more articles can be bought for $300 after the price decrease.\n\n## Step 16: Let's recalculate the new price per article correctly. If 5 more articles can be bought for $300 after the price decrease, then the new price per article is $300 / 5.\n\n## Step 17: Calculating $300 / 5 gives us the correct new price per article.\n\n## Step 18: The correct new price per article is $60.\n\n## Step 19: However, we need to find the price after the 15% decrease, which is 85% of the original price.\n\n## Step 20: To find the original price, we can use the fact that the new price is 85% of the original price, and the new price is $60.\n\n## Step 21: We can express this as 0.85 * Original Price = $60.\n\n## Step 22: To find the original price, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.85.\n\n## Step 23: Calculating $60 / 0.85 gives us the original price.\n\n## Step 24: The original price is approximately $70.59.\n\n## Step 25: However, we are looking for the new selling price after the 15% decrease.\n\n## Step 26: We can calculate the new selling price by multiplying the original price by 0.85.\n\n## Step 27: However, we can also calculate the new selling price directly from the given information that 5 more articles can be bought for $300 after the price decrease.\n\n## Step 28: We can express the new price as 0.85 * Original Price = $60.\n\n## Step 29: However, we can also express the new price as (Original Price - 15% of Original Price) = $60.\n\n## Step 30: We can express 15% of the Original Price as 0.15 * Original Price.\n\n## Step 31: We can express the new price as Original Price - 0.15 * Original Price = $60.\n\n## Step 32: We can simplify this to 0.85 * Original Price = $60.\n\n## Step 33: However, we can also express the new price as (Original Price -

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Define the problem and the equations\nWe are given two pieces of information: the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. We can write the equations based on the given information: x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000.\n\n## Step 2: Use the difference of squares formula\nThe difference of squares formula is (x^2 - y^2) = (x + y)(x - y). We can substitute this formula into the first equation: (x + y)(x - y) = 256000.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute the sum of the numbers into the equation\nWe know that x + y = 1000. We can substitute this into the equation from step 2: 1000(x - y) = 256000.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for (x - y)\nTo solve for (x - y), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 1000: x - y = 256000 / 1000 = 256.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the system of equations\nNow we have a system of two equations: x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256. We can add these two equations to eliminate y: 2x = 1256.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x\nTo solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 1256 / 2 = 628.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for y\nNow that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y. We'll use the equation x + y = 1000: 628 + y = 1000. Subtracting 628 from both sides gives us y = 372.\n\n## Step 8: Check the answer\nWe have found the two numbers: x = 628 and y = 372. We can check if the difference between their squares is indeed 256000: 628^2 - 372^2 = 396064 - 138144 = 257920, which is not correct. However, we can also check if the sum of the numbers is 1000: 628 + 372 = 1000, which is correct.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the correct answer\nSince the difference between the squares of the two numbers is not 256000, we need to re-examine our calculations. However, we can see that the sum of the numbers is indeed 1000, which matches one of the options.\n\n## Step 10: Re-check the calculations\nUpon re-checking the calculations, we can see that the mistake was in the calculation of the difference between the squares of the two numbers. The correct calculation is: 628^2 - 372^2 = 396064 - 138144 = 257920, which is not equal to 256000. However, we can try to find the correct answer by looking at the options.\n\n## Step 11: Look at the options\nLooking at the options, we can see that option B)628, 372 is the only option that has the correct sum of the numbers, which is 1000.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the correct answer\nSince option B)628, 372 has the correct sum of the numbers, we can conclude that this is the correct answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$",

(5100 - x).\n## Step 4:  We know that the amount Mohan will receive on attaining the age of 26 years can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n## Step 5:  In this case, the principal amount for Mohan is x, the rate of interest is 4% or 0.04, the time period is 3 years (from 23 to 26), and the interest is compounded annually, so n = 1.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the amount Mohan will receive on attaining the age of 26 years is x(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) = x(1.04)^3.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, the amount Sohan will receive on attaining the age of 26 years is (5100 - x)(1.04)^3.\n## Step 8:  Since the problem states that they will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26 years, we can set up the equation: x(1.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1.04)^3.\n## Step 9:  We can simplify this equation by canceling out the (1.04)^3 term from both sides, which gives us x = 5100 - x.\n## Step 10:  Solving for x, we get 2x = 5100, which implies x = 2550.\n## Step 11:  However, this is not among the given options.

Ant A moves at 9 cm/hour and ant B moves at 6 cm/hour. So, their combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm/hour.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the time it takes for the ants to meet\nSince the ants are moving towards each other, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. The distance between the farms is 75 cm, and the combined speed of the ants is 15 cm/hour. So, the time it takes for the ants to meet is 75 / 15 = 5 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled by ant A\nSince ant A moves at a speed of 9 cm/hour, we can multiply its speed by the time it takes for the ants to meet to find the distance traveled by ant A. Distance = speed * time = 9 * 5 = 45 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

Given that the perimeter is 340 meters, we can set up the equation as 340 = 2(l + w).\n\n## Step 2: Solve for the sum of the length and width\nFrom the equation 340 = 2(l + w), we can simplify it to l + w = 340 / 2 = 170. This gives us the sum of the length and width of the rectangular plot.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the effect of adding a 1-metre broad boundary\nWhen a 1-metre broad boundary is added around the rectangular plot, the new dimensions will be (l + 2) and (w + 2), because 1 metre is added to each side of the length and width.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the new perimeter\nThe new perimeter will be P' = 2((l + 2) + (w + 2)), which simplifies to P' = 2(l + w + 4).\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the value of (l + w) into the new perimeter equation\nWe know from Step 2 that l + w = 170.

Rearranging the terms, we get 4B^2 + B - 150 = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for B.\nWe can solve the quadratic equation 4B^2 + B - 150 = 0 using the quadratic formula: B = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the discriminant and the two possible values for B.\nThe discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(4)(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. The two possible values for B are B = (-1 + √2401) / (2*4) and B = (-1 - √2401) / (2*4).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the two possible values for B.\nSince √2401 = 49, the two possible values for B are B = (-1 + 49) / 8 and B = (-1 - 49) / 8. Simplifying further, we get B = 48 / 8 and B = -50 / 8.\n\n## Step 8: Choose the positive value for B.\nSince the breadth cannot be negative, we choose the positive value B = 48 / 8 = 6.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the length using the value of B.\nSubstituting B = 6 into the expression for the length, we get L = 4(6) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2(Length + Breadth). Substituting the values of L and B, we get Perimeter = 2(25 + 6) = 2(31) = 62.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$",

        "model_response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours to cover the distance between City A and City B.\n2. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to cover the distance between City B and City A.\n3. Since the two trains are moving in opposite directions, we need to find the time when they meet. Let's assume they meet at time t.\n4. The distance between City A and City B is the same as the distance between City B and City A, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nFor train M: Distance = 4 hours × Speed\nFor train N: Distance = 3 hours 30 minutes × Speed\n\nSince the distance is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 hours × Speed = 3 hours 30 minutes × Speed\n\nTo solve for the time when they meet, we need to find the time when the two trains are at the same position. Let's convert the time to hours:\n\n3 hours 30 minutes = 3.5 hours\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 hours × Speed = 3.5 hours × Speed\n\nSince the speed is the same for both trains, we can cancel it out:\n\n4 hours = 3.5 hours\n\nThis is not possible, as 4 hours is not equal to 3.5 hours. However, we can see that the two trains are moving at different speeds. To find the time when they meet, we need to find the time when the distance between them is equal to the sum of their speeds.\n\nLet's assume the speed of train M is x km/h and the speed of train N is y km/h. Then, the time when they meet is:\n\nt = (Distance / (x + y))\n\nWe know that the distance between City A and City B is 4 hours × x km/h, and the distance between City B and City A is 3.5 hours × y km/h. Since the two trains are moving in opposite directions, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h = Distance\n\nTo solve for the time when they meet, we need to find the values of x and y. However, we are given the options, so we can try to find the correct answer by testing each option.\n\nLet's start with option A) 1 hr 23 min. We can convert this to hours and minutes:\n\n1 hour 23 minutes = 1.383 hours\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h = Distance\n\nWe know that the distance between City A and City B is 4 hours × x km/h, and the distance between City B and City A is 3.5 hours × y km/h. Since the two trains are moving in opposite directions, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h = 4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (x + (x - 4 hours × x km/h / 3.5 hours))\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (x + (x - 4 hours × x km/h / 3.5 hours)) = 4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (2x - 4 hours × x km/h / 3.5 hours)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x - 4 hours × x km/h / 3.5 hours = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 4 hours × x km/h / (2 × 3.5 hours)\n\nx = 2 hours × x km/h / 3.5 hours\n\nx = 0.5714 × x km/h\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of x into the equation:\n\n4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h = Distance\n\nSubstituting x = 0.5714 × x km/h, we get:\n\n4 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h = Distance\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2.2856 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h = Distance\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = (Distance - 2.2856 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours\n\nSubstituting x = 0.5714 × x km/h, we get:\n\ny = (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of y into the equation:\n\nt = (Distance / (x + y))\n\nSubstituting x = 0.5714 × x km/h and y = (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours, we get:\n\nt = (Distance / (0.5714 × x km/h + (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours))\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nt = (Distance / (0.5714 × x km/h + (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours))\n\nSubstituting Distance = 4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h, we get:\n\nt = (4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h) / (0.5714 × x km/h + (4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nt = (4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h) / (0.5714 × x km/h + (2.6928 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h) / 3.5 hours)\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 0.5714 × x km/h and y = (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours into the equation:\n\nt = (4 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / (0.5714 × 0.5714 × x km/h + (2.6928 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / 3.5 hours)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nt = (2.286 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / (0.3273 × x km/h + (1.5384 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / 3.5 hours)\n\nNow, we can substitute Distance = 4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h into the equation:\n\nt = (2.286 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / (0.3273 × x km/h + (1.5384 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (4 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / 3.5 hours)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nt = (2.286 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (2.6928 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h) / 3.5 hours) / (0.3273 × x km/h + (1.5384 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (2.6928 hours × x km/h + 3.5 hours × y km/h) / 3.5 hours) / 3.5 hours)\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 0.5714 × x km/h and y = (Distance - 1.3072 hours × x km/h) / 3.5 hours into the equation:\n\nt = (2.286 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (2.6928 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (Distance - 1.3072 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h) / 3.5 hours) / 3.5 hours) / (0.3273 × 0.5714 × x km/h + (1.5384 hours × 0.5714 × x km/h + 3.5 hours × (2.6928 hours × 0.5714",

So, the total wages for the entire fortnight is 15 * 90 = $1350.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days\nThe total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days is 609 + 644 = $1253.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the wage on the 8th day\nThe wage on the 8th day is the difference between the total wages for the entire fortnight and the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days. So, the wage on the 8th day is 1350 - 1253 = $97.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{D}$",

So, the total area of the rectangle is 27 * 17 = 459 square cm.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the side length of the square\nSince the wire is rebent to form a square, the total area of the square will be the same as the total area of the rectangle. The area of a square is given by the formula side^2. So, we can set up the equation side^2 = 459.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for the side length of the square\nTo find the side length of the square, we take the square root of both sides of the equation. So, side = sqrt(459).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the square root of 459\nThe square root of 459 is approximately 21.45.\n\n## Step 5: Round the side length to the nearest whole number\nSince the options are all whole numbers, we round the side length to the nearest whole number. The side length is approximately 21.45, which rounds to 21 or 22, but since 21 is not an option, we choose the closest option which is 22.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$",

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Define the problem and the constraints given\nWe are given a three-digit number where the sum of its digits is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from this number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\n\n## Step 2: Represent the three-digit number algebraically\nLet's represent the three-digit number as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are the digits of the number.\n\n## Step 3: Express the sum of the digits and the sum of the squares of the digits algebraically\nThe sum of the digits is given as a + b + c = 17, and the sum of the squares of the digits is a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the relationship between the original number and the number with the digits reversed\nWhen we subtract 495 from the original number, we get a new number that is the reverse of the original number. This can be represented as (100c + 10b + a) - 495.\n\n## Step 5: Set up an equation based on the relationship between the original number and the number with the digits reversed\nWe can set up the equation (100a + 10b + c) - 495 = 100c + 10b + a.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for the difference between a and c\nDividing both sides of the equation by 99, we get a - c = 5.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the possible values of a and c\nSince a and c are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9. Given that a - c = 5, we can consider the possible pairs of (a, c) that satisfy this condition.\n\n## Step 9: Find the possible pairs of (a, c) that satisfy a - c = 5\nThe possible pairs of (a, c) that satisfy a - c = 5 are (6, 1), (7, 2), (8, 3), and (9, 4).\n\n## Step 10: Check which pair of (a, c) satisfies the condition a + b + c = 17\nWe need to find the pair of (a, c) that satisfies the condition a + b + c = 17. Let's try the pairs (6, 1), (7, 2), (8, 3), and (9, 4) to see which one works.\n\n## Step 11: Check the pair (6, 1)\nIf a = 6 and c = 1, then a + b + c = 6 + b + 1 = 17, which implies b = 10. However, b cannot be 10 since it is a digit.\n\n## Step 12: Check the pair (7, 2)\nIf a = 7 and c = 2, then a + b + c = 7 + b + 2 = 17, which implies b = 8. This pair satisfies the condition a + b + c = 17.\n\n## Step 13: Check the pair (8, 3)\nIf a = 8 and c = 3, then a + b + c = 8 + b + 3 = 17, which implies b = 6. This pair also satisfies the condition a + b + c = 17.\n\n## Step 14: Check the pair (9, 4)\nIf a = 9 and c = 4, then a + b + c = 9 + b + 4 = 17, which implies b = 4. However, this pair does not satisfy the condition a + b + c = 17.\n\n## Step 15: Check the pair (7, 2) and (8, 3) for the sum of the squares of the digits\nWe need to check which pair of (a, c) satisfies the condition a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109. Let's try the pairs (7, 2) and (8, 3) to see which one works.\n\n## Step 16: Check the pair (7, 2)\nIf a = 7 and c = 2, then a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 7^2 + b^2 + 2^2 = 49 + b^2 + 4 = 109, which implies b^2 = 56. However, b^2 cannot be 56 since it is a perfect square.\n\n## Step 17: Check the pair (8, 3)\nIf a = 8 and c = 3, then a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 8^2 + b^2 + 3^2 = 64 + b^2 + 9 = 109, which implies b^2 = 36. This pair satisfies the condition a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.\n\n## Step 18: Determine the correct pair of (a, c)\nBased on the previous steps, the pair (8, 3) satisfies both conditions a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.\n\n## Step 19: Find the value of b\nSince a + b + c = 17 and a = 8, c = 3, we can find the value of b as b = 17 - 8 - 3 = 6.\n\n## Step 20: Form the original number\nThe original number is 100a + 10b + c = 100(8) + 10(6) + 3 = 863.\n\n## Step 21: Form the number with the digits reversed\nThe number with the digits reversed is 100c + 10b + a = 100(3) + 10(6) + 8 = 368.\n\n## Step 22: Check if subtracting 495 from the original number gives the number with the digits reversed\nSubtracting 495 from the original number 863, we get 368, which is the number with the digits reversed.\n\n## Step 23: Determine the correct answer\nThe correct answer is the number that is formed by the digits in the reverse order, which is 368.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

Given that the train runs at a speed of 100 miles/hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination, the total distance traveled is 100 * 10 = 1000 miles.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the distance covered before the rain\nThe train covers a quarter of the distance before it starts raining. Since the total distance is 1000 miles, the distance covered before the rain is 1000 / 4 = 250 miles.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before the rain\nThe train runs at a speed of 100 miles/hour for the first 250 miles. Using the formula time = distance / speed, the time taken to cover the distance before the rain is 250 / 100 = 2.5 hours.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to be covered after the rain\nThe remaining distance to be covered after the rain is 3/4 of the total distance, which is 3/4 * 1000 = 750 miles.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance after the rain\nThe train runs at a speed of 75 miles/hour for the remaining 750 miles. Using the formula time = distance / speed, the time taken to cover the remaining distance after the rain is 750 / 75 = 10 hours.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total journey duration\nThe total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the distance before the rain and the time taken to cover the remaining distance after the rain. Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$",

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the ratio of investments multiplied by the time period for A and B.\nA invested Rs.40,000 for 12 months, so his total investment is 40,000 * 12 = 480,000. B invested Rs.60,000 for 10 months (12 - 2), so his total investment is 60,000 * 10 = 600,000.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the ratio of investments multiplied by the time period for A and B.\nThe ratio of A's and B's investments is 480,000 : 600,000, which simplifies to 4 : 5.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total investment of A and B.\nThe total investment of A and B is 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of C's investment multiplied by the time period to the total investment of A and B.\nC's investment is Rs.120,000, and let's assume he joined after x months. So, his total investment is 120,000 * (12 - x). The ratio of C's investment to the total investment of A and B is (120,000 * (12 - x)) : 1,080,000.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the ratio of C's share to the total profit.\nC's share is Rs.150,000, and the total profit is Rs.375,000. The ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 : 375,000, which simplifies to 2 : 5.\n\n## Step 6: Set up the equation using the ratios from step 4 and step 5.\nWe can set up the equation (120,000 * (12 - x)) / 1,080,000 = 2 / 5.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation for x.\nCross-multiplying, we get 5 * 120,000 * (12 - x) = 2 * 1,080,000. Simplifying, we get 600,000 * (12 - x) = 2,160,000. Dividing both sides by 600,000, we get 12 - x = 3.6. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get -x = -8.4. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = 8.4.\n\n## Step 8: Convert the decimal to months.\nSince x is in months, we can convert 8.4 to 8 months and 4 months.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the correct answer choice.\nSince C joined after B joined, we need to add the 2 months that B joined to the 8 months that C joined. This gives us 10 months. However, this is not an option. We need to look for the closest option.\n\n## Step 10: Choose the closest option.\nThe closest option is 23 months, which is 23 months after A joined.\n\n## Step 11: Convert 23 months to months after B joined.\nSince B joined 2 months after A, we need to subtract 2 from 23. This gives us 21 months.\n\n## Step 12: Convert 21 months to months after B joined.\nHowever, we need to choose the closest option, and the closest option is 23 months.\n\n## Step 13: Convert 23

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased with the given amount.\nTo find the maximum number of trousers, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of one trouser. total_amount = 810, cost_per_trousers = 70. max_trousers = total_amount / cost_per_trousers = 810 / 70 = 11.57. Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount after purchasing the maximum number of trousers.\nTo find the remaining amount, we multiply the cost of one trouser by the maximum number of trousers. remaining_amount = cost_per_trousers * max_trousers = 70 * 11 = 770.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of shirts that can be purchased with the remaining amount.\nTo find the number of shirts, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one shirt. cost_per_shirt = 30. num_shirts = remaining_amount / cost_per_shirt = 770 / 30 = 25.67. Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a shirt, the number of shirts that can be purchased is 25.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of trousers to shirts.\nTo find the ratio, we divide the number of trousers by the number of shirts. ratio = max_trousers / num_shirts = 11 / 25 = 0.44.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the correct option based on the ratio.\nSince the ratio is not a simple fraction, we need to find the closest option. The options are in the form of \"X Trousers\". We can see that the ratio is approximately 0.44, which is closest to 11 Trousers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{E}$",

Therefore, L(x,y) = x + y + [x + y] and R(x,y) = 2x + 2y. In this case, L(x,y) = R(x,y) because [x + y] = x + y.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the case when x and y are not both integers\nIf x and y are not both integers, then [x] < x and [y] < y.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of units produced in a year is 420 * 12 = 5040 units. The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for a year is 5040 * 110 = $552,400.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the minimum yearly profit required\nThe minimum yearly profit required is given as $626,400.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total revenue required for the minimum yearly profit\nTo find the total revenue required, we need to add the total production cost to the minimum yearly profit. Total revenue = minimum yearly profit + total production cost = $626,400 + $552,400 = $1,178,800.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the minimum selling price per component\nTo find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total revenue required by the total number of units produced in a year. Minimum selling price per component = total revenue / total number of units = $1,178,800 / 5040 = $234.\n\n## Step 5: Round the minimum selling price to the nearest option\nSince the minimum selling price per component is $234, which is not among the options, we need to round it to the nearest option. The closest option is $230.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$",

        "model_response": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what we're looking for: 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.\n## Step 2:  Let's denote the first of these odd numbers as x. Since we're dealing with consecutive odd numbers, the next four numbers can be represented as x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8.\n## Step 3:  The sum of these 5 consecutive odd numbers is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20.\n## Step 4:  We're told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. This means (5x + 20) / 10 must be a perfect square.\n## Step 5:  Simplifying the expression, we get (5x + 20) / 10 = 0.5x + 2. This expression needs to be a perfect square.\n## Step 6:  Since we're dealing with a two-digit odd number, x must be an odd number between 10 and 99 (inclusive), because the smallest two-digit odd number is 11 and the largest is 99.\n## Step 7:  We need to find a value of x that makes 0.5x + 2 a perfect square. Let's consider the options given and see which one fits this criterion.\n## Step 8:  We'll start by checking option A) 47. If x = 47, then 0.5x + 2 = 0.5(47) + 2 = 23.5 + 2 = 25.5, which is not a perfect square.\n## Step 9:  Next, we'll check option B) 91. If x = 91, then 0.5x + 2 = 0.5(91) + 2 = 45.5 + 2 = 47.5, which is not a perfect square.\n## Step 10:  Moving on to option C) 41. If x = 41, then 0.5x + 2 = 0.5(41) + 2 = 20.5 + 2 = 22.5, which is not a perfect square.\n## Step 11:  Next, we'll check option D) 67. If x = 67, then 0.5x + 2 = 0.5(67) + 2 = 33.5 + 2 = 35.5, which is not a perfect square.\n## Step 12:  Finally, we'll check option E) 44. However, 44 is not an odd number, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers we're looking for.\n## Step 13:  Since none of the options directly give us a perfect square when divided by 10, we need to consider the nature of the question and the options provided. The question asks for a number that \"can be one of these 5 numbers,\" which implies that we should look for a number that fits the criteria of being a two-digit odd number and being part of a sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square.\n## Step 14:  Given the constraints and the process of elimination, we need to find a number that fits the sequence and the condition of the sum being a perfect square when divided by 10.\n## Step 15:  However, upon closer inspection, we realize that we made an error in our approach. We should be looking for a number that, when part of a sequence of 5 consecutive odd numbers, the sum of those numbers divided by 10 results in a perfect square.\n## Step 16:  Let's correct our approach and directly evaluate the options given in the context of the problem statement.\n## Step 17:  We need to find a number that, when part of a sequence of 5 consecutive odd numbers, the sum of those numbers divided by 10 results in a perfect square.\n## Step 18:  Given the options, we need to find a number that fits the sequence and the condition of the sum being a perfect square when

Substituting the values, we get time = 3 km / 6 km/h = 0.5 hours.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the time from hours to minutes\nSince the question asks for the time in minutes, we need to convert 0.5 hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 0.5 hours is 0.5 * 60 = 30 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

We know that the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, so we need to convert this to miles per second. \n\nThere are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can convert the speed as follows:\n\n120 miles/hour / 3600 seconds/hour = 0.0333 miles/second\n\nNow, we know that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long. This means that the train travels 1 mile in 3 seconds. \n\nHowever, we need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel. This means that we need to add the time it takes for the train to travel the length of the tunnel to the time it takes for the train to enter the tunnel.\n\nSince the train travels 1 mile in 3 seconds, we can find the time it takes for the train to travel the length of the tunnel as follows:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 1 mile / 0.0333 miles/second\nTime = 30 seconds\n\nHowever, this is the time it takes for the train to travel the length of the tunnel. We need to add the time it takes for the train to enter the tunnel, which is 3 seconds.\n\nSo, the total time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is:\n\nTotal Time = 30 seconds + 3 seconds\nTotal Time = 33 seconds\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD) 33 seconds",

Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his work rate is 1/8 of a house per day. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his work rate is 1/12 of a house per day.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days\nMr. Brown works for 8 days at a rate of 1/6 of a house per day. So, the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days is 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 of a house.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days\nMr. Black works for 6 days at a rate of 1/8 of a house per day. So, the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days is 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 of a house.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black\nThe total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black is 4/3 + 3/4. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So, the total work done is (4/3)*(4/4) + (3/4)*(3/3) = 16/12 + 9/12 = 25/12 of a house.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the remaining work\nSince there are 3 houses in total, the remaining work is 3 - 25/12.

So, the remaining work is 36/12 - 25/12 = 11/12 of a house.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the time it will take Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work\nMr. Blue's work rate is 1/12 of a house per day. To complete 11/12 of a house, it will take him 11/12 / (1/12) = 11 days.\n\n## Step 7: Since Mr. Blue can complete the remaining work in 11 days, it will take him 11 days to complete the contract.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{D}$",

The time taken by Allen to travel 2d is 2d/54, and the time taken by Bob to travel d + 48 is (d + 48)/78.\n## Step 5:  Since they meet for the second time at the same point, the time taken by both of them to meet for the second time is the same.

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Determine the area of the original square piece of cloth\nThe area of each triangle is 70 square feet, and since the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles, the area of the rectangular piece is 2 times the area of each triangle, which is 2 * 70 = 140 square feet.\n\n## Step 2: Find the dimensions of the rectangular piece\nSince the rectangular piece was formed by trimming a square piece of cloth by 4 feet on one edge, let's denote the side length of the original square as 'x'. The area of the original square is x^2. The area of the rectangular piece is (x - 4) * x = x^2 - 4x.\n\n## Step 3: Set up an equation to find the side length of the original square\nSince the area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet, we can set up the equation x^2 - 4x = 140.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation to find the side length of the original square\nRearranging the equation, we get x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0. This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as (x - 14)(x + 10) = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 14 or x = -10. Since the side length of the square cannot be negative, we take x = 14.\n\n## Step 5: Find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth\nThe perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 times the side length, which is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

The total time taken for the journey is 1 hour, so we can set up the equation: x/10 + x/5 = 1.\n5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to eliminate the fractions: x + 2x = 10.\n6. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 10.\n7.

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the area of the square\nThe area of the square is calculated by squaring the length of one side. The length of one side is 20 cm, so the area of the square is 20 * 20 = 400 square cm.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the area of one semi-circle\nThe diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of one side of the square, which is 20 cm. The radius of the semi-circle is half of the diameter, which is 10 cm. The area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * π * r^2, where r is the radius. So, the area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * 3.14 * 10^2 = 157 square cm.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total area of two semi-circles\nSince there are two semi-circles, the total area of the two semi-circles is 2 * 157 = 314 square cm.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the area of the remaining paper\nThe area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the total area of the two semi-circles. So, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 314 = 86 square cm.\n\n## Step 5: Round the area to two decimal places\nThe area of the remaining paper is 86 square cm, which is equal to 8.67 when rounded to two decimal places. However, this is not among the options. We need to recheck our calculations.\n\n## Step 6: Recheck the calculations\nLet's recheck the calculations. The area of the square is 400 square cm. The area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * 3.14 * 10^2 = 157 square cm. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2 * 157 = 314 square cm. The area of the remaining paper is 400 - 314 = 86 square cm. However, we need to recheck the area of the semi-circles.\n\n## Step 7: Recheck the area of the semi-circles\nThe area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * π * r^2, where r is the radius.

We will use this value to recalculate the area of the semi-circles.\n\n## Step 9: Recalculate the area of the semi-circles\nThe area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * 3.14159 * 10^2 = 157.0794 square cm. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2 * 157.0794 = 314.1588 square cm.\n\n## Step 10: Recalculate the area of the remaining paper\nThe area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the total area of the two semi-circles. So, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 314.1588 = 85.8412 square cm.\n\n## Step 11: Round the area to two decimal places\nThe area of the remaining paper is 85.8412 square cm, which is equal to 8.58 when rounded to two decimal places.

The area of the remaining paper is 400 - 314.1588 = 85.8412 square cm. However, we need to recheck the area of the square.\n\n## Step 13: Recheck the area of the square\nThe area of the square is 20 * 20 = 400 square cm.

The time period is one year, so t = 1.\n## Step 3:  We are also given that the total amount Charles received at the end of the investment is $54,080.\n## Step 4:  We can now substitute these values into the compound interest formula to solve for P, the principal amount.\n## Step 5:  Plugging in the values, we get 54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1).\n## Step 6:  Simplifying the equation, we get 54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2.\n## Step 7:  Further simplifying, we get 54,080 = P(1.04)^2.\n## Step 8:  To find the value of P, we need to divide both sides of the equation by (1.04)^2.\n## Step 9:  (1.04)^2 is equal to 1.0816, so we get 54,080 / 1.0816 = P.\n## Step 10:  Calculating this, we get P = 50,000.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $50,000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$",

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm, and when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. We need to find the area of the original sheet.\n\n## Step 2:  Set up equations based on the information given about the perimeters when folded.\nLet's denote the length of the sheet as L and the width as W. When folded along one set of sides (let's say length), the perimeter of each part is 48cm, which means L + L = 48, since the two halves are equal. Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides (width), the perimeter of each part is 66cm, which means W + W = 66.\n\n## Step 3:  Solve the equations to find the length and width of the sheet.\nFrom the first set of equations, we get 2L = 48, which simplifies to L = 24. From the second set of equations, we get 2W = 66, which simplifies to W = 33.\n\n## Step 4:  Calculate the area of the sheet using the length and width found.\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length * Width. Substituting the values of L and W, we get Area = 24 * 33.\n\n## Step 5:  Perform the multiplication to find the area.\nArea = 24 * 33 = 792.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$",

The area A = L * W. We are given A = 240. So, we can express one variable in terms of the other: L = 240 / W.\n\n## Step 3: Use the fact that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced.\nSince one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, this side must be either the length or the width of the yard. Without loss of generality, let's assume this side is the width, W = 10.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for the length of the yard.\nNow that we know W = 10, we can substitute this value into the equation from Step 2 to find the length: L = 240 / 10 = 24.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total amount of fencing needed.\nThe total amount of fencing needed is the sum of the lengths of the three sides of the yard that will be fenced.
