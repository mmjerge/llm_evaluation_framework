This means that the ratio of black marbles to the total number of marbles pulled out the second time is 1:20.\n## Step 7:  Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can use this ratio to find the total number of marbles in the bag.\n## Step 8:  The ratio of black marbles to the total number of marbles in the bag is 1:20, which is equivalent to 1/20.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag, Q, can be calculated as 20 times the number of black marbles, which is 20 * 1 = 20.\n## Step 10:  However, we also need to consider the initial 20 marbles that were painted black and put back in the bag.

Since the train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour and takes 10 hours to reach its destination, the total distance can be calculated as speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed * time = 100 * 10 = 1000 miles.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the distance covered before slowing down\nThe train covers a quarter of the distance before slowing down. So, the distance covered before slowing down is 1/4 * 1000 = 250 miles.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance\nAfter slowing down, the train covers the remaining 3/4 of the distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour. The remaining distance is 3/4 * 1000 = 750 miles. The time taken to cover this distance can be calculated as time = distance / speed = 750 / 75 = 10 hours.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total journey duration\nThe total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining 3/4 of the distance.

Since we are looking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we should consider the scenario where the overlap is maximized.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum overlap between the two groups.\nThe maximum overlap would occur if all students who took part in the debating session also attended the prom night. This means that the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session (70 students) could also be the maximum number of students who attended the prom night.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.\nTo find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to subtract the total number of students who attended the prom night and the debating session from the total number of students in the school. However, since we are considering the maximum overlap, we should subtract the minimum number of students who attended the prom night (90 students) and the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session (70 students) from the total number of students (200 students).\n\n## Step 8: Perform the calculation for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session.\nMaximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session = 200 - (90 + 70) = 200 - 160 = 40 students.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$",

This means that the elevator covers the remaining distance (20 steps) in 10 minutes. Since the elevator is moving at a constant speed, the distance it covers in 10 minutes is equal to its speed multiplied by the time:\n\n20 steps = x steps/minute \u00d7 10 minutes\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n20 = 10x\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\nx = 2 steps/minute\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario: when you walk 10 steps and stop, the elevator takes 20 minutes to reach the ground. This means that the elevator covers the remaining distance (10 steps) in 20 minutes. Again, the distance it covers in 20 minutes is equal to its speed multiplied by the time:\n\n10 steps = x steps/minute \u00d7 20 minutes\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n10 = 20x\n\nDividing both sides by 20, we get:\n\nx = 0.5 steps/minute\n\nWait, what? We just found two different values for x! This is a classic sign of a problem with multiple solutions. However, in this case, we can see that the two values are actually the same:\n\nx = 2 steps/minute = 0.5 steps/minute \u00d7 4\n\nThis means that the elevator's speed is actually 2 steps per minute, and the second scenario is just a red herring.\n\nSo, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps per minute.",

    "question": "Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?",
    "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year.\nThe store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month in the first 10 months of this year. So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 * 10 = 200.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period.\nThe store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month last year. Since the question asks for the average over the entire 22 months period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold in the last 12 months of last year. This is 42 * 12 = 504. Adding this to the 200 sold in the first 10 months of this year, we get a total of 504 + 200 = 704 microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period.\nTo find the average, we divide the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period by the total number of months, which is 22. So, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month is 704 / 22 = 32.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$",

    "model_response": "## Step 1: Define the variables and the given information\nWe are given that the average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. This means that (highest score + lowest score) / 2 = x. We are also given that the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5.\n\n## Step 2: Express the sum of all scores in the class\nThe sum of all scores in the class can be expressed as the average score (y) multiplied by the number of students (z), which is yz.\n\n## Step 3: Express the sum of the highest and lowest scores\nSince the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, we can express their sum as 2x.\n\n## Step 4: Express the sum of the remaining scores\nThe sum of the remaining scores (excluding the highest and lowest scorers) can be found by subtracting the sum of the highest and lowest scores from the total sum of all scores in the class. This gives us yz - 2x.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers\nTo find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to divide the sum of the remaining scores by the number of remaining students, which is z - 2. This gives us (yz - 2x) / (z - 2).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression by factoring out y from the numerator: y(z - 2) / (z - 2). The (z - 2) terms cancel out, leaving us with y.\n\n## Step 7: Express the final answer in terms of x, y, and z\nHowever, we need to express the final answer in terms of x, y, and z.

    "question": "A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?",
    "model_response": "Let the speed of the jeep in the forward journey be x km/hr. Then, the distance travelled by the jeep in the forward journey is 6x km. The speed of the jeep in the return journey is (x + 12) km/hr. The distance travelled by the jeep in the return journey is 4(x + 12) km. Since the distance travelled by the jeep in the forward and return journeys is the same, we can set up the equation: 6x = 4(x + 12) Expanding the equation, we get: 6x = 4x + 48 Subtracting 4x from both sides, we get: 2x = 48 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 24 Therefore, the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 24 km/hr. The distance travelled by the jeep in the forward journey is 6x = 6(24) = 144 km. The distance travelled by the jeep in the return journey is 4(x + 12) = 4(24 + 12) = 4(36) = 144 km.

To find out, we need to calculate how many years have passed since you were 2 years old.\n\n60 (your current age) - 2 (your age at the time) = 58 years\n\nSince your brother was 1 year old when you were 2, and 58 years have passed since then, we can add 58 to his age at the time:\n\n1 (his age at the time) + 58 = 59\n\nSo, your brother is currently 59 years old.",

    "model_response": "## Step 1: Determine the original retail price in terms of the wholesale cost.\nLet's denote the wholesale cost as W. The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, so it can be expressed as W + 0.60W = 1.60W.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the selling price in terms of the original retail price.\nThe appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. This means the selling price is 80% of the original retail price, which is 0.80 * 1.60W = 1.28W.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the percent more than the wholesale cost that the appliance was sold for.\nTo find the percent more than the wholesale cost, we need to compare the selling price (1.28W) to the wholesale cost (W). The difference is 1.28W - W = 0.28W.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the percent increase from the wholesale cost to the selling price.\nThe percent increase is the difference (0.28W) divided by the original cost (W), multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. This is (0.28W / W) * 100 = 28%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$",

    "question": "An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200, 400, 600 and 800km/hr. Find the average speed of the plane around the field?",
    "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by the plane\nTo find the average speed of the plane, we first need to calculate the total distance it traveled. Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, we can denote the length of each side as 's'. Therefore, the total distance traveled is 4s.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total time taken by the plane\nNext, we need to calculate the total time taken by the plane to travel the total distance. The time taken to travel each side is given by the speed of the plane on that side divided by the length of the side. Therefore, the time taken to travel each side is 200/s, 400/s, 600/s, and 800/s.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total time taken by the plane\nTo find the total time taken, we need to add up the time taken to travel each side. Therefore, the total time taken is (200/s) + (400/s) + (600/s) + (800/s).\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the total time taken\nWe can simplify the total time taken by finding a common denominator, which is s. Therefore, the total time taken is (200 + 400 + 600 + 800)/s = 2000/s.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the average speed of the plane\nThe average speed of the plane is given by the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Therefore, the average speed is 4s / (2000/s).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the average speed\nWe can simplify the average speed by canceling out the s terms. Therefore, the average speed is 4 * 2000 / s = 8000 / s.\n\n## Step 7: Express the average speed in km/hr\nSince the speed is given in km/hr, we need to express the average speed in km/hr. However, we realize that the length of the side 's' is not given, and we cannot express the average speed in km/hr without knowing the length of the side.\n\n## Step 8: Realize that the average speed is independent of the length of the side\nHowever, we can express the average speed in terms of the given speeds. The average speed is the harmonic mean of the given speeds. The harmonic mean of n numbers is given by n / (1/x1 + 1/x2 + ... + 1/xn).\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the harmonic mean of the given speeds\nThe harmonic mean of the given speeds is 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by finding a common denominator, which is 1200. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 4 / ((6 + 3 + 2 + 1.5)/1200).\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by adding the fractions in the denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 4 / (12.5/1200).\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 4 * 1200 / 12.5.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by canceling out the 5 in the numerator and denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 4 * 240 / 2.5.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by canceling out the 2 in the numerator and denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 4 * 120 / 1.25.\n\n## Step 15: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by canceling out the 1.25 in the denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 4 * 120 / 1.25.\n\n## Step 16: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 480 / 1.25.\n\n## Step 17: Simplify the harmonic mean\nWe can simplify the harmonic mean by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Therefore, the harmonic mean is 384.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{384}$",

Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?",
    "model_response": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the rates at which hoses A and B fill the pool.\n## Step 2:  We know that hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate of filling the pool is 1/8 of the pool per hour.\n## Step 3:  In the first 2 hours, hose A filled the pool alone, so it filled 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool.\n## Step 4:  This means that 3/8 of the pool was left to be filled by both hoses A and B working together in the next 3 hours.\n## Step 5:  Let's denote the rate at which hose B fills the pool as B. Then, the combined rate of hoses A and B is 1/8 + B.\n## Step 6:  Since they filled 3/8 of the pool in 3 hours, their combined rate is (3/8) / 3 = 1/8 of the pool per hour.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, we have the equation 1/8 + B = 1/8, which simplifies to B = 0. This means that hose B does not contribute to filling the pool.\n## Step 8:  However, this result seems counterintuitive, as we know that hose B must contribute to filling the pool. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n## Step 9:  We know that hose A filled 1/4 of the pool in 2 hours, and then hoses A and B together filled 3/8 of the pool in 3 hours.\n## Step 10:  This means that in 3 hours, hose A filled 1/4 + (3/8 - 1/4) = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8 of the pool.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, in 3 hours, hose A filled 3/8 of the pool, and hose B filled the remaining 3/8 - 3/8 = 0 of the pool.\n## Step 12:  This result is still counterintuitive, as we know that hose B must contribute to filling the pool.

We are told that 24% of all students at Daifu university are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n## Step 2:  Additionally, we know that 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This implies that 80% of the members of the swim team are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n## Step 3:  Let's assume that the total number of students at Daifu university is represented by the variable $x$. This means that the number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team is $0.24x$.\n## Step 4:  We are asked to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team. Let's denote this percentage as $p$.

In 8 days, he completes 8 * (1/6) = 4/3 of a house.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the amount of work left after Mr. Brown goes on vacation\nSince Mr. Brown completes 4/3 of a house in 8 days, the amount of work left is 1 - 4/3 = 1/3 of a house.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the amount of work done by Mr. Black in 6 days\nMr. Black's work rate is 1/8 of a house per day. In 6 days, he completes 6 * (1/8) = 3/4 of a house.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the amount of work left after Mr. Black finishes his work\nSince Mr. Black completes 3/4 of a house in 6 days, the amount of work left is 1/3 - 3/4 = -1/12 of a house.

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation gives us 4B^2 + B - 150 = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation from step 4 for B.\nWe can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: B = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150. Plugging in these values gives us B = (-(1) \u00b1 \u221a((1)^2 - 4(4)(-150))) / (2(4)).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula.\nSimplifying the expression under the square root gives us B = (-(1) \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 2400)) / 8, which further simplifies to B = (-(1) \u00b1 \u221a2401) / 8.\n\n## Step 7: Solve for the square root of 2401.\nThe square root of 2401 is 49.\n\n## Step 8: Substitute the square root of 2401 into the expression for B from step 6.\nSubstituting the square root of 2401 into the expression for B gives us B = (-(1) \u00b1 49) / 8.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for the two possible values of B.\nSolving for the two possible values of B gives us B = (-1 + 49) / 8 and B = (-1 - 49) / 8. Simplifying these expressions gives us B = 48 / 8 and B = -50 / 8, which further simplifies to B = 6 and B = -6.25.\n\n## Step 10: Discard the negative value of B since breadth cannot be negative.\nDiscarding the negative value of B gives us B = 6.\n\n## Step 11: Substitute the value of B into the expression for L from step 1 to find the length.\nSubstituting B = 6 into the expression for L gives us L = 4(6) + 1, which simplifies to L = 24 + 1, and further simplifies to L = 25.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the values of L and B.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2B. Substituting L = 25 and B = 6 into the formula gives us P = 2(25) + 2(6), which simplifies to P = 50 + 12, and further simplifies to P = 62.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{62}$",

From the second relationship, we have 3 rolls = 5 baguettes in terms of falafel content.\n\n## Step 3: Find a common unit to compare the different types of bread directly.\nTo compare pita breads and baguettes directly, we need to find a common unit. Since we know the relationship between rolls and baguettes, we can use this to find the relationship between pita breads and baguettes.\n\n## Step 4: Use the relationships to find how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes.\nFirst, we find out how many rolls are equivalent to two baguettes. Since 3 rolls = 5 baguettes, we can find the number of rolls equivalent to 2 baguettes by setting up a proportion: (3 rolls)/(5 baguettes) = x rolls / 2 baguettes. Solving for x, we get x = (3 rolls * 2 baguettes) / 5 baguettes = 6/5 rolls. Now, we know that 6 pita breads = 2 rolls. So, we can find the number of pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes by setting up another proportion: 6 pita breads / 2 rolls = y pita breads / (6/5 rolls). Solving for y, we get y = (6 pita breads * 6/5 rolls) / 2 rolls = 18/5 pita breads.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the answer to find the number of pita breads equivalent to two baguettes.\nWe can simplify 18/5 to 3.6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.6}$",

    "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the total width of all pickets\nThe total width of all pickets is the number of pickets multiplied by the width of each picket. Since each picket is 1/2 inch wide, the total width of all pickets is x * (1/2) = x/2 inches.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the total space between pickets\nThere are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. Since there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces between pickets. Therefore, the total space between pickets is (x-1) * 6 inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total length of the fence\nThe total length of the fence is the sum of the total width of all pickets and the total space between pickets. Therefore, the total length of the fence is (x/2) + (x-1) * 6 inches.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the total length of the fence from inches to feet\nSince there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to divide the total length of the fence in inches by 12 to get the length in feet. Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is ((x/2) + (x-1) * 6) / 12.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression for the length of the fence\nTo simplify the expression, we can first simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (x/2) + (x-1) * 6 = (x/2) + 6x - 6. Then, we can combine like terms: (x/2) + 6x - 6 = (6x + x/2) - 6 = (12x + x)/2 - 6 = (13x)/2 - 6. Now, we can divide the expression by 12: ((13x)/2 - 6) / 12 = (13x)/24 - 6/12 = (13x)/24 - 1/2.\n\n## Step 6: Write the final expression for the length of the fence\nThe final expression for the length of the fence is (13x)/24 - 1/2.\n\n## Step 7: Convert the fraction 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 24\nTo convert the fraction 1/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 24, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 12: 1/2 = (1*12)/(2*12) = 12/24.\n\n## Step 8: Rewrite the expression for the length of the fence with a common denominator\nThe expression for the length of the fence is (13x)/24 - 12/24.\n\n## Step 9: Combine the fractions\nTo combine the fractions, we can subtract the numerators: (13x - 12)/24.\n\n## Step 10: Write the final expression for the length of the fence\nThe final expression for the length of the fence is (13x - 12)/24.\n\n## Step 11: Write the final expression in the required format\nThe final expression for the length of the fence is (13x - 12)/24.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13x-12}{24}}$",

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?",
    "model_response": "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned to the forest.

The ratio of tagged deer in the second sample to the total number of deer in the second sample is assumed to be equal to the ratio of tagged deer in the first sample to the total number of deer in the forest.\n## Step 4:  Mathematically, this can be represented as $\\frac{20}{500} = \\frac{300}{x}$, where $x$ is the total deer population in the forest.\n## Step 5:  To find the value of $x$, we can cross-multiply and solve for $x$. This gives us $20x = 300 \\times 500$.\n## Step 6:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{300 \\times 500}{20}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is $x = \\frac{300 \\times 500}{20} = 7500$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7500}$",

When the square is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, it forms a rectangular piece with dimensions $s$ by $s-4$.\n## Step 3:  The area of each triangle formed after cutting the rectangular piece diagonally is given as 70 square feet. Since the two triangles are congruent, the total area of the rectangular piece is $2 \\times 70 = 140$ square feet.\n## Step 4:  We can express the area of the rectangular piece as the product of its length and width, which gives us the equation $s(s-4) = 140$.\n## Step 5:  Solving this quadratic equation, we get $s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0$.

To find the smallest multiple of 0.56 that is greater than 501, we can divide 501 by 0.56 and round up to the nearest integer. 501/0.56 \u2248 894.64, so the smallest multiple of 0.56 that is greater than 501 is 895. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 895.",
