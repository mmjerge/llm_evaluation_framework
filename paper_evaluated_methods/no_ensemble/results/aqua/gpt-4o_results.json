    "question": "A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?",
    "model_response": "Let's start by defining the variables and using trigonometry to analyze the scenario. \n\nLet \\( h \\) be the height of the tower, and \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) be the horizontal distances from the car to the base of the tower when the angles of elevation are 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, respectively. We're given that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.\n\n**Step 1: Apply trigonometric relationships for both angles of elevation.**\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0:\n\\[\n\\tan(45\u00b0) = \\frac{h}{x_1}\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\tan(45\u00b0) = 1\\), therefore:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{h}{x_1} \\implies x_1 = h\n\\]\n\nWhen the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0:\n\\[\n\\tan(60\u00b0) = \\frac{h}{x_2}\n\\]\nWe know that \\(\\tan(60\u00b0) = \\sqrt{3}\\), therefore:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{h}{x_2} \\implies x_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the difference in distances and use the uniform speed.**\n\nThe difference in distances the car travels over the course of changing from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 is:\n\\[\nx_1 - x_2 = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = h \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{h(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nSince it takes 10 minutes to cover this distance at a uniform speed, we denote this speed by \\( v \\) (in units of height per minute):\n\\[\nv = \\frac{\\frac{h(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{\\sqrt{3}}}{10} = \\frac{h(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the remaining distance to the base of the tower.**\n\nThe remaining distance to the base of the tower from the position where the elevation angle is 60\u00b0 is:\n\\[\nx_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the time required to cover the remaining distance.**\n\nUsing the speed \\( v \\) calculated:\n\\[\n\\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{remaining distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{h(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}{10\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot 10\\sqrt{3}}{h(\\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \\frac{10 \\cdot h}{h(\\sqrt{3} - 1)} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\n\\]\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)\n\\]\n\nSo, after \\(5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)\\) minutes, the car will reach the base of the tower. Simplifying the expression further:\n\n\\[\n5(\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\approx 5 (1.732 + 1) = 5 \\times 2.732 = 13.66 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the car will reach the base of the tower in approximately \\( 13.66 \\) minutes.",

    "question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?",
    "model_response": "Let's denote the original price of the item as \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, we know that the item is discounted by 22%, so the price after the discount is:\n\\[\nx - 0.22x = 0.78x\n\\]\n\nNext, the customer uses a $20-off coupon on the discounted price, so the price the customer actually pays is:\n\\[\n0.78x - 20\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the amount the customer paid (\\(0.78x - 20\\)) is $1.90 more than half of the original price. Hence, we can write:\n\\[\n0.78x - 20 = \\frac{x}{2} + 1.90\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\). First, we clear the constant terms from both sides by adding 20 to both sides:\n\\[\n0.78x = \\frac{x}{2} + 21.90\n\\]\n\nNext, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 0.78x = x + 43.80\n\\]\n\\[\n1.56x = x + 43.80\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( x \\) from both sides to collect \\( x \\) terms on one side:\n\\[\n1.56x - x = 43.80\n\\]\n\\[\n0.56x = 43.80\n\\]\n\nFinally, solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 0.56:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{43.80}{0.56} = 78.2142857 \\approx 78.21\n\\]\n\nAccordingly, the original price of the item was approximately $78.21. We've stated the price with a sufficient degree of precision as calculated, but in practical/real-world shopping scenarios, prices are typically rounded to reflect standard currency units; thus, you may consider converting to nearest penny where needed.",

This can be rewritten as:\n- \\( P(\\text{neither A nor B}) \\)\n\nThis is the complement of the event that at least one of the stocks will increase in value.

Converting both fractions to have the same denominator:\n\\[ \\frac{7}{8}x = \\frac{7 \\cdot 9}{8 \\cdot 9}x = \\frac{63}{72}x \\]\n\\[ \\frac{7}{18}x = \\frac{7 \\cdot 4}{18 \\cdot 4}x = \\frac{28}{72}x \\]\n\nNow, subtract the second fraction from the first:\n\\[ \\frac{63}{72}x - \\frac{28}{72}x = \\frac{63 - 28}{72}x = \\frac{35}{72}x \\]\n\nGiven that this difference equals 770:\n\\[ \\frac{35}{72}x = 770 \\]\n\nNext, solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 770 \\times \\frac{72}{35} \\]\n\\[ x = 770 \\times \\frac{72}{35} \\]\n\nDivide 770 by 35:\n\\[ 770 \\div 35 = 22 \\]\n\nThus, substitute back into the equation:\n\\[ x = 22 \\times 72 \\]\n\\[ x = 1584 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1584} \\]",

    "question": "A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?",
    "model_response": "To determine the length of the fence, we need to account for both the width of the pickets and the spaces between them. We'll approach this step by step:\n\n1. **Width of the Pickets:**\n   Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. If there are \\(x\\) pickets, then the total width of all the pickets together is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Space Between Pickets:**\n   There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. For \\(x\\) pickets, there are \\(x-1\\) spaces between them. Therefore, the total space between the pickets is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times (x-1) \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Length of Fence:**\n   The total length of the fence is the sum of the total width of the pickets and the total space between them:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) + \\left(6(x-1)\\right) \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying this expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}x + 6(x-1) = \\frac{1}{2}x + 6x - 6 = \\frac{1}{2}x + 6x - 6 = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{12}{2}x - 6 = \\frac{13}{2}x - 6 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Feet:**\n   There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, to convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{13}{2}x - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the length of the fence in feet is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{13x - 12}{24}}\n\\]",

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?",
    "model_response": "To determine the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to analyze when he arrives at the station relative to the times the trains arrive.\n\nThe main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M. So, the times for the main line trains are 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, etc.\n\nThe harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M. So, the times for the harbor line trains are 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, etc.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the man arrives at the station at a random time between 5:00 A.M. and 5:10 A.M. because of the 10-minute cyclic nature of the train arrivals. We will consider just one 10-minute interval and generalize the result.\n\n1. **Main line train arrival times in the interval [5:00 A.M, 5:10 A.M.):**\n   - 5:00 A.M.\n\n2. **Harbor line train arrival times in the interval [5:00 A.M., 5:10 A.M.):**\n   - 5:02 A.M.\n\nThe critical periods are:\n- The period between 5:00 and 5:02 (duration: 2 minutes) when the man would catch the main line train.\n- The period between 5:02 and 5:10 (duration: 8 minutes) when the man would catch the harbor line train if he arrives during this time.\n\nSo, if the man arrives at a random time between 5:00 A.M. and 5:10 A.M., the probability of catching the main line train (i.e., arriving between 5:00 and 5:02) is:\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2 \\]\n\nAnd the probability of catching the harbor line train (i.e., arriving between 5:02 and 5:10) is:\n\\[ \\frac{8 \\text{ minutes}}{10 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train, which could either be the main line train or the harbor line train, is influenced by these probabilities. Since he will always catch the first train he arrives before, the overall conclusion is that his specific arrival does not affect catching *a* train (as he will always catch one). If we only consider the probability of catching the main line train specifically, it is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2} \\]\n\nIf the question implies simply catching any train and not specifying, it would then be definite (1 or 100%) as there is no possibility of not catching one given our periodic assumption.",

    "model_response": "To determine the length of each side of the square, we need to first calculate the total length of the wire, which is originally in the shape of a rectangle.\n\nGiven:\n- The length of the rectangle is 27 cm.\n- The breadth of the rectangle is 17 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Breadth}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (27 \\text{ cm} + 17 \\text{ cm}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times 44 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 88 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nThis wire is then rebent to form a square. The perimeter of the square is equal to the total length of the wire, which is 88 cm.\n\nThe perimeter of a square is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{Side length} \\]\n\nLet \\( s \\) be the length of each side of the square. Then:\n\\[ 4s = 88 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTo find \\( s \\):\n\\[ s = \\frac{88 \\text{ cm}}{4} \\]\n\\[ s = 22 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of each side of the square will be 22 cm.",

    "question": "A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?",
    "model_response": "To solve this problem, let's first define the amount each nephew receives as \\(x\\).\n\nGiven:\n- Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives \\(4x\\).\n- Each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew, so each son receives \\(5x\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount distributed using these expressions.\n\n1. **Amounts received by the sons:**\n   There are 5 sons, and each son receives \\(5x\\).\n   Total amount received by the sons = \\(5 \\times 5x = 25x\\).\n\n2. **Amounts received by the daughters:**\n   There are 4 daughters, and each daughter receives \\(4x\\).\n   Total amount received by the daughters = \\(4 \\times 4x = 16x\\).\n\n3. **Amounts received by the nephews:**\n   There are 2 nephews, and each nephew receives \\(x\\).\n   Total amount received by the nephews = \\(2 \\times x = 2x\\).\n\nAdding these amounts together to equal the total amount of Rs 8600:\n\\[ 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 \\]\n\nCombining the terms:\n\\[ 43x = 8600 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{8600}{43} \\]\n\\[ x = 200 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the amount each daughter receives:\n\\[ \\text{Amount each daughter receives} = 4x = 4 \\times 200 = 800 \\]\n\nTherefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.",

    "model_response": "Let's denote Meenu's weight as \\( M \\).\n\nAccording to Meenu, her weight is 29 Kgs plus half of her weight:\n\\[ M = 29 + \\frac{M}{2} \\]\n\nTo find \\( M \\), we can solve this equation step-by-step:\n\n1. Subtract \\(\\frac{M}{2}\\) from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms involving \\( M \\) on one side:\n\\[ M - \\frac{M}{2} = 29 \\]\n\n2. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{2M}{2} - \\frac{M}{2} = 29 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2M - M}{2} = 29 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{M}{2} = 29 \\]\n\n3.

    "question": "Roy was suffering from severe headaches. He went to see his doctor and the doctor gave him 5 tablets asking him to take one tablet every 15 minutes.\nHow much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?",
    "model_response": "To determine how much time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets, given that he is supposed to take one tablet every 15 minutes, we need to calculate the total time based on the intervals between taking each tablet.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- Roy takes the first tablet immediately, so there's no waiting time for the first one.\n- He takes the second tablet 15 minutes after the first.\n- He takes the third tablet 15 minutes after the second.\n- He takes the fourth tablet 15 minutes after the third.\n- He takes the fifth tablet 15 minutes after the fourth.\n\nLet's count the intervals:\n1. First tablet to the second tablet: 15 minutes.\n2. Second tablet to the third tablet: 15 minutes.\n3. Third tablet to the fourth tablet: 15 minutes.\n4. Fourth tablet to the fifth tablet: 15 minutes.\n\nThere are 4 intervals of 15 minutes each. Thus, the total time taken to consume all 5 tablets is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15 \\text{ minutes} = 60 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it will take Roy 60 minutes (or 1 hour) to consume all the 5 tablets.",
