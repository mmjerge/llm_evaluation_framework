It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?

(b) The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.
