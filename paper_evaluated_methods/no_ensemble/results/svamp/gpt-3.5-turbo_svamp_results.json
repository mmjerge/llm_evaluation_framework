        "model_response": "Initially Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so let's say Ed had x marbles and Doug had x-29 marbles.\n\nAfter Ed lost 17 marbles at the playground, he had x-17 marbles.\n\nWe know that x-17 = (x-29). We can rearrange the equation to find x:\n\nx-17 = x-29\nx - x = -29 + 17\n0 = -12\n\nThis means that x = -12, which is not possible in this context. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the initial information provided.",

        "model_response": "The frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.\nThe mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.\nTherefore, the mouse jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

        "model_response": "To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we can divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took him to finish it.\n\nPages read per day = Total pages / Days taken\nPages read per day = 112 pages / 16 days\nPages read per day = 7 pages per day\n\nTherefore, Frank read 7 pages per day.",
