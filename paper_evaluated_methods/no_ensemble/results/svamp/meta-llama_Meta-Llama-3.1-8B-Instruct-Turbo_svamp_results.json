Then, the amount of flour needed is x + 2.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute the known values into the equation\nWe know that the amount of flour needed is 11 cups, and the amount of sugar needed is 7 cups. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + 2 = 11.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x\nHowever, we realize that the equation 7 + 2 = 11 is not an equation with x. Instead, we need to set up an equation with x to represent the situation. Let's say the amount of sugar Mary has already put in is x. Then, the amount of flour she has already put in is x + 2.\n\n## Step 7: Set up an equation to represent the situation\nWe know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups, and Mary has already put in x + 2 cups of flour. So, the equation is: x + 2 + y = 11, where y is the amount of flour Mary still needs to put in.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the amount of flour Mary still needs to put in\nSince Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, and she has 7 cups of sugar, she needs 7 + 2 = 9 cups of flour.\n\n## Step 9: Substitute the known values into the equation\nWe know that the amount of flour Mary still needs to put in is 9 cups. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2 + 9 = 11.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for x\nSimplifying the equation, we get: x + 11 = 11.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for x\nSubtracting 11 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 0.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the amount of flour Mary has already put in\nSince x = 0, Mary has already put in 0 + 2 = 2 cups of flour.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

        "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on the candy bar.\nDan spent $2 on the candy bar.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on the chocolate.\nDan spent $3 on the chocolate.\n\n## Step 3: Find the difference in the amount spent on chocolate and the candy bar.\nTo find out how much more Dan spent on chocolate than on the candy bar, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the cost of the chocolate. Difference = Cost of chocolate - Cost of candy bar = $3 - $2 = $1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

        "question": "How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?",
        "model_response": "## Step 1: Determine the initial difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug.\nEd had 29 more marbles than Doug.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the number of marbles Ed had after losing 17 at the playground.\nEd initially had 29 more marbles than Doug, but we don't know the exact number of marbles Ed or Doug had. Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as x. Then Ed had x + 29 marbles. After losing 17 marbles, Ed had (x + 29) - 17 = x + 12 marbles.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug after Ed lost 17 marbles.\nThe difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug after Ed lost 17 marbles is (x + 12) - x = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

        "question": "How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?",
        "model_response": "## Step 1: Determine how far the frog jumped.\nThe frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, who jumped 19 inches. So, the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.\n\n## Step 2: Determine how far the mouse jumped.\nThe mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, who jumped 29 inches. So, the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper.\nThe mouse jumped 49 inches and the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. So, the mouse jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",
