        "model_response": "To find the time when the two trains meet each other, we need to determine the distance between them and consider their relative speeds. \n\nTrain A starts at 11 am, so by 2 pm (the time Train B starts), it has been traveling for 3 hours at 40 kmph, covering a distance of 120 km (40 kmph x 3 hours).\n\nNow, when Train B starts at 2 pm, there are already 120 km covered by Train A. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their individual speeds, which is 40 kmph + 72 kmph = 112 kmph.\n\nUsing the formula, time = distance/speed, we get:\nTime = 120 km / 112 kmph = 1.07 hours\n\nSo, the two trains will meet each other 1.07 hours after Train B starts at 2 pm, which is approximately at 3:04 pm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: 3:04 pm",

If the merchant does not have $20,000 on hand, he can borrow money at an interest rate that allows him to pay back the loan and still save money compared to paying the full amount.\n\nThe discount amount is 4% of $20,000, which is $800. Therefore, the merchant would need to pay $19,200 within 30 days to take advantage of the discount.\n\nIf the merchant borrows money at an interest rate higher than the savings of $800, he would end up paying more than $20,000 in total.\n\nTo calculate the simple interest rate, we can use the formula: \nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\n\n$800 = $19,200 x Rate x 1/12 (since 30 days is 1/12 of a year)\n\nRate = $800 / $19,200 x 12 = 0.042, or 4.2%\n\nTherefore, the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money is 4.2%.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

        "question": "A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?",
        "model_response": "First, let's find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver:\n\nVolume of coin = \u03c0r^2h\nwhere r = diameter/2 = 15/2 = 7.5 mm\nand h = thickness = 2 mm\n\nVolume of coin = \u03c0(7.5)^2 * 2\nVolume of coin = \u03c0 * 56.25 * 2\nVolume of coin = \u03c0 * 112.5 mm^3\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, the volume of aluminum in the coin would be half of the total volume, which is:\n\nVolume of aluminum = \u03c0 * 112.5 / 2\nVolume of aluminum = \u03c0 * 56.25 mm^3\n\nNow, let's find the weight of the coin made purely of aluminum. We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Let the weight of aluminum be x grams, then the weight of silver would be 2x grams.\n\nWeight of the coin made of aluminum and silver:\nWeight = weight of aluminum + weight of silver\n30 grams = x + 2x\n30 grams = 3x\nx = 30 / 3\nx = 10 grams\n\nTherefore, the weight of the coin made purely of aluminum, which measures 1 x 30 mm, would be 10 grams.\n\nFinal Answer: 10",

        "model_response": "To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, we first need to calculate the area of the rectangular plot and then the area of the larger rectangle formed by adding the 1-meter broad boundary.\n\nLet the length of the rectangular plot be L meters and the breadth be B meters.\n\nGiven that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters:\n2(L + B) = 340\nL + B = 170\nB = 170 - L\n\nThe area of the rectangular plot = L * B\n\nArea of the larger rectangle = (L + 2) * (B + 2)\n= (L + 2) * (170 - L + 2)\n= L * (170 - L) + 2(170 - L) + 2L + 4\n= 170L - L^2 + 340 - 2L + 2L + 4\n= -L^2 + 170L + 344\n\nNow, the cost of gardening at the rate of 10 per square meter:\nCost = 10 * Area of the larger rectangle\n= 10 * (-L^2 + 170L + 344)\n= -10L^2 + 1700L + 3440\n\nTo find the maximum or minimum value of the cost function, we can differentiate it with respect to L and equate it to zero:\nd(Cost)/dL = -20L + 1700\n-20L + 1700 = 0\nL = 85\n\nTherefore, the length of the rectangular plot is 85 meters. \nThe breadth B = 170 - 85 = 85 meters.\n\nCost = -10*85^2 + 1700*85 + 3440\nCost = -10*7225 + 144500 + 3440\nCost = -72250 + 144500 + 3440\nCost = 72250\n\nFinal Answer: $72250",

Let's denote the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies as D.\n\nInitially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake.
